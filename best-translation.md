## October 6, 1998 (Tuesday)

I attended SEGA’s **"New Challenge Conference 2."** It seems that with the upcoming next-generation hardware, full polygons will still be tough to handle. If we aim for film-quality visuals on the Dreamcast or PS2, it’s probably best to avoid full polygons.

In the end, even with increased polygon counts on models that previously ran on PCs, the result only gives a slightly better impression. There’s a limit to focusing on details. We need to grasp the essence of how things appear. After seeing today’s Dreamcast software, I got a clear sense of the direction for *MGS2.*

It’s not about the quality of the visuals. It’s about the game itself. The focus will be on gameplay and elements that couldn’t be achieved before, even if that means using low-polygon models. For example, Leaving enemy soldiers' corpses on the ground or having 100 enemy soldiers on screen at once


## October 7, 1998 (Wednesday)

I went to see *Saving Private Ryan* with **Matsubana**, **Nishimura**, and **Nakamura**. We had our advance tickets ready and headed to Shibuya Cine Tower.

But wow, it was already standing room only!  
Is it that popular?  
...and then I heard an announcement: **"Today, tickets are 1,000 yen!"**

Oh, right, it was Movie Day.

I didn’t have the stamina to stand for a 3-hour movie, so I looked up, and just then, the sign for the theater across the street caught my eye: *Austin Powers...*

We quickly crossed the lightly raining street and switched to *Austin Powers.*

Man, it was hilarious.  
But I wonder if this kind of humor is only understandable to people in their 30s and up?

When developing *MGS2*, I might need to rewatch *007*.

## October 23, 1998 (Friday)

Today is the day of my barium test for my stomach, duodenum, small intestine, and large intestine.

In the KGB, they used to say “using barium” referred to deliberately leaking false information to check for security breaches.

I left the house 30 minutes later than usual today. My son waved at me until I disappeared from sight at the door.

Commuting is tough with luggage for a 6-day, 5-night business trip. It was a good idea to send just my suit to the office in advance yesterday.


## October 29, 1998 (Thursday)

We did motion capture at **IMAGICA** today. Since we had a morning meeting, we didn’t leave until after 10 a.m.

We were guided to the capture studio, Sakuratei. It’s been two years since I last visited IMAGICA. The last time was when we edited a video for TGS right after I moved to Tokyo, working late into the night with the agency staff. By the time I arrived, the setup was already complete. Under **Toyopi’s** direction, we began capturing.

First up was Mei Ling. **Mizpin’s** model of Mei Ling (without textures) moved in real-time, perfectly synced with the actor’s movements. From a distance, it looked incredibly lifelike. This time, we used magnetic capture. Since the actions were small, we recorded in the smallest studio.

The actor was a beautiful actress who had even played a child role in *Silent Hill.* We added direction to each shot, though it was my first time guiding an actor’s performance, so I was figuring things out as I went. Despite that, we’ve come a long way since the experiment we did at the research lab three years ago. The workflow is much smoother now. It’s clear that handling everything in-house is impossible. We need to prioritize efficiency.

At noon, I returned to Ebisu, then went back to IMAGICA at 5 p.m.

**Toyopi** was much more relaxed, likely due to his experience. We finished capturing all the planned shots, and with 30 minutes left, we decided to do some improvisation. The actress performed *Dojo Sukui* (a traditional Japanese comedic dance), using Naomi’s file—it was fascinating to watch.

Afterward, I greeted the actress when she removed the data suit and helmet. She was a beautiful and lovely person.

I wonder if this kind of profession will become more common in the future.



## October 30, 1998 (Friday)

I had planned to go to the hospital this morning, but since my stomach feels fine, I canceled the visit and went to the office as usual. The medication runs out today, but that’s okay.

Since the planning retreat, **Fukushima** has been lacking energy. I’m also feeling down. I had been relying on Fukushima, but just as **Shinkawa** and the others pointed out, the characters and plot are lacking in appeal. 

It looks like I’ll have to take over and handle everything directly again this time.

## October 31, 1998 (Saturday)

I bought a Game Boy Color (GBC) and left it unused for a while.

Since there aren’t any games I want, it seems it might end up being left unused.

I found the original *Mario* for the Game Boy in my room. I connected it to the Game Boy and started playing, and wow, it’s really fun.

This is the essence of gaming. The colors are limited to four and a bit hard to see, but even so, it’s more than enough.

At 2:00 p.m., I left Ebisu with Muraoka-san and the sound team. We arrived at Pantheon around 2:15 p.m. The line for the Tokyo Fantasia Film Festival extended from the 1st to the 5th floor.

One of our sound team members had asked a stranger (wearing an *Escape from L.A.* hat) to hold a spot before he came to the office, so we managed to secure a good position around the 2nd floor. As a thank-you, we gave the guy a Metal Gear hat.

Since there were still more than four hours to wait, Muraoka-san and I went to Tower Records and a bookstore. I bought the *Dark City* soundtrack CD and a sniper novel.

We rejoined the line, but waiting like this at my age is pretty tough. Coincidentally, the guy with the L.A. hat had a friend who worked at Konami. That friend brought his girlfriend along.

Now our group had five people. As the start time approached, more TV cameras appeared. The L.A. guy got caught by a camera and was interviewed.

At the last minute, in a moment of madness, he shouted, “Metal Gear is now on sale!”

After 5:30 p.m., a friend of our sound staff arrived. His friend was Matsuno-san, the creator of Square's *FFT.* Like proper businessmen, Matsuno-san and I exchanged business cards on the stairs. We chatted about recent events while we waited. He seemed like a really nice guy.

Finally, at 6:00 p.m., the event started. We secured a great spot about five rows from the front. The interior was decorated with lighting, giving it a different feel—almost unrecognizable as Pantheon.

The opening was spectacular, with a kung fu action event followed by guest greetings. Guests included Bruce Lee’s wife and Go Nagai.

At 7:00 p.m., *Vampires* (*Vampires: The Last Battle*) finally started. The film opened with an interview with John Carpenter. He looked healthier than before, and the interview was quite interesting.

*Vampires* marked Carpenter's comeback!! It was well done. The theme was excellent.

This story was perfect for Carpenter.

After the movie, Muraoka-san and I had dinner in Harajuku. While drinking beer, I talked about the planning retreat and explained the outline of *MGS2.* Come to think of it, the first person I discussed the plot and concept of the previous game with was also Muraoka-san. I remember it was at a tea shop in Sannomiya Station. After that, we drank at a bar in Ebisu until midnight.

## November 1, 1998 (Sunday)

They’re broadcasting news about astronaut John Glenn on TV. I’ve made a promise to my son that we’ll go to space together someday, but will I be able to keep it? Though, according to him, the “rocket” we’ll take isn’t a space shuttle but the one from *Wallace and Gromit’s A Grand Day Out.*

I spent the day at home reading. I finished Nancy Collins’ *Black Rose.*

## November 4, 1998 (Wednesday)

We had a TV crew from Germany come for an interview. The interviewer and the cameraman arrived carrying their equipment in heavy aluminum cases. Both had very stereotypically German appearances. The interviewer had an earring, and the other guy looked strikingly similar to Agent Mulder (*David Duchovny*) from *The X-Files.* He looked so much like him that I wanted Scott to translate my comment, but Scott said, “He doesn’t look like him” and refused to translate.

I learned that Scott had lived in New York for a while, so I immediately asked him about the Manhattan area. I asked about the distance between the Statue of Liberty and Wall Street, as well as a bit about the geography and safety of places like SoHo, Chinatown, Little Italy, and Brooklyn. Based on this, it seems like setting *MGS2* in Manhattan shouldn’t be a problem. I asked Scott to get me a detailed map of Manhattan. I’ll trust him when he says he knows it better than Motomachi (a famous area in Yokohama).

The idea of an armed group taking over an offshore plant (artificial island) built to clean up an oil spill feels a bit weak. So, we’ll have them take the visiting president hostage as well. To subvert the player's expectations, we’ll kill the president right at the start of the story. But the twist is that the president was a body double. The real president, Solidus, whose term is almost over, fakes his death and goes underground.

## November 8, 1998 (Sunday)

I went to the office in the afternoon. RMC informed us that there is a stop bug in the PAL version of *MGS.* I asked Uehara-kun for details. As expected, it's a memory overflow issue. At the heliport, if you destroy the surveillance camera with a Stinger missile and then immediately put on the thermal goggles, the game freezes. We’ll fix it and send it to CS International tomorrow. Uehara-kun is staying overnight to burn the ROM. Lately, he's gained confidence, composure, and a sense of responsibility—this is good to see.

I rented some videos at Tsutaya: *Hell's Guard* and *Breakdown.* After putting my son to bed, I watched Kurt Russell’s *Breakdown.* It was so gripping that I found myself tensing up. I wonder if that tension comes from the fact that Kurt Russell's character is just an ordinary, vulnerable man.

To create that kind of tension in *MGS,* the protagonist would need to be an ordinary person... but then it wouldn’t be a game.

At 9 p.m., the Japanese TV premiere of John Woo’s *Blackjack* aired. The main character, played by Dolph Lundgren, is voiced by Akio Ōtsuka. There’s a sequence where Lundgren, after being blinded by a flashbang, follows a child's instructions (“Enemy at 12 o’clock!”) to shoot at enemies—this could be useful. I watched the opening scene, then went to bed.

There was a big earthquake late at night. It was a magnitude 4 in Kanagawa and a 3 in Tokyo. Earthquakes are unpleasant.

I kept having weird dreams.

## November 9, 1998 (Monday)

At 3 p.m., we had a recording session at Central Recording for the third episode of the *MGS* radio drama. Mr. Saka, who played Colonel Cortez, participated, and it was nostalgic to work with him again. As expected, Saka was amazing. When he gets into character, his performance is so intense that it reminds me of Gates Becker. It was so gripping that it made you feel short of breath just listening to it.

Several magazines came to the voiceover session to cover the recording. We took a commemorative photo with the voice actors in the studio. Ōtsuka-san (*Solid Snake’s* voice actor) kindly said, “Director, please stand in the center!” but I chose to stand at the far end. It seems Ōtsuka really likes *MGS* (the role of Snake).

Saka’s performance was so outstanding that I started thinking of a character specifically for him in *MGS2.* Later, I had a casual conversation with Muraoka at a ramen shop in Ginza.

We discussed an idea about a legendary sniper who served during the Vietnam War and took down 64 enemies. But in truth, he wasn’t a sniper—he was a spotter. Due to a mistake on his first mission, the real legendary sniper was killed. Now, he works as a security officer on an offshore plant. His beloved wife has passed away, and his only son has distanced himself from him. His past became known, and since then, he's been estranged from his son's family.

He knows the offshore plant well and ends up serving as Snake’s spotter in the end.

I also thought about a role for Kaneto Shiozawa, but I couldn’t come up with a good part for him.

Afterward, I watched *The Replacement Killers* in Ginza. The content made me think it would have been a great film if John Woo had directed it, even though the story was the same. Chow Yun-Fat didn’t look cool, and the gunfight scenes lacked creativity. Only John Woo knows how to film him in a truly manly way.

Today's name: Raiden Branigan.  
Solidus is gas, a mirage, a non-existent existence.

## November 10, 1998 (Tuesday)

I’m finally putting together the final development report for *MGS.* With a total of 39 people involved, summarizing everything is a major task.

I went to Tsutaya with Matsubana to return *Breakdown* and *Hell’s Guard* and rented *Sniper* and *Face/Off.*

This morning’s newspaper had an article about the supercomputer “Blue Pacific,” jointly developed by the Livermore Laboratory and IBM. I wondered what such a high-speed computer would be used for, and it turns out it’s for subcritical nuclear testing again. It seems virtual reality nuclear tests are going to become increasingly common.

Arsenal Gear will also be equipped with 10 “Blue Atlantic” supercomputers running in parallel. It’s not just an arsenal but a system that collects its own data, feeds it back into experiments, and accelerates its readiness for deployment. There’s no longer any need for simulated warhead launch drills. It’s an arsenal of nuclear testing that can be deployed in real combat.

I’m thinking of introducing a seasoned veteran who prevents aging with telomerase enzymes—a legendary hero from the Second World War. Someone who showed even Big Boss the ropes in various strategies. Physically close to 100 years old and boasting over half a century of combat experience, codename “Old Man” is said to be a walking piece of military history. He calls all of the soldiers of the world “youngsters.”

“No one has seen more battlefields than me. And no one alive has come closer to death than I have.”

He attacks using a Panzerfaust. I'll leave the details of the weapon to Hirano-kun. As for the voice, Saka-san would be great.

While having a meeting with Murata-kun about the radio drama, I heard that Kikuko Inoue is returning to the field. I also learned that Akio Ōtsuka is going to appear in a live-action movie. We’ll need to be careful when scheduling for his appearance in *MGS2.*

## November 11, 1998 (Wednesday)

At 9:30 a.m., we gathered at the CS Business Headquarters and, with 12 development directors from various KCE divisions, went to the SCE headquarters. We were kept waiting for a while in the familiar 1st-floor lobby, where we submit our masters.

We were led to the conference room. It was my first time on the upper floors, and the floor was pristine. Every woman I met there was beautiful, offering radiant smiles. As expected from SCE.

We were first shown into a small private room. There, we watched five different demos on five stacked prototype PS2 units (graphics boards). It was truly impressive. If the work is done right, achieving real-time visuals on par with pre-rendered cinematics is very feasible. This hardware is ideal for cinematic-style games. But *MGS* is different. Visually, we’ll likely still be at a disadvantage.

We moved to another room for a technical breakdown of the specs. It’s not just a typical game console—it’s a beast of high-end hardware. What used to be manually crafted data is now being processed through calculations. Effects like explosions, wind, and smoke won’t be handled by a director’s craftsmanship anymore—they’ll be generated in real-time using physics-based middleware.

In real-time 3D, elements like fire and water are no longer just static data; they’re represented through dynamic simulations, driven by real-time calculations. This changes the way we approach development significantly. Things like hair movement, which animators used to create by hand, will now be handled through physics simulations. While this brings us closer to realism, it may also lead to a loss of the artistic individuality that animators used to inject into the game.

We took one of the graphics hardware sets back to the office. I’ll never forget the complex conversation I had with Uehara-kun during the taxi ride from Akasaka to Ebisu.

After returning to Ebisu, I gathered the core team for a briefing. I reaffirmed my decision for *MGS2*—we'll focus on having a massive number of enemies (about 100 soldiers, each around 1,000 polygons) on-screen, even if it means sticking to low-poly models.

## November 12, 1998 (Thursday)

I started writing the concept document. I’ve had to switch from WordPerfect to MS Word, as times have changed. Like with this journal, something just feels off. The layout and how the text aligns on the monitor are subtly different.

I’ve been using WordPerfect for project proposals and specs ever since Konami switched to Macs—about four years now. Switching from Ichitaro back then also took time to adjust to. During *Metal Gear,* I wrote everything in WordPerfect. Over the years, I unconsciously developed a rhythm, arranging text, fonts, and layouts in a way that helped maintain a steady flow while writing.

It’s not that the commands or interface are hard to use. It’s more of a deeper, instinctual discomfort. Back during *Metal Gear,* I wrote everything in WordPerfect, and Fukushima handled converting it into MS Word.

After a few pages, the discomfort became too much, so I stopped for the day. I ordered the *MGS2* logo from Hisashi, asking for one version that doesn’t reuse the old logo and another simplified version. Of course, I joked that we might as well put *MGS3* on it.

We had to kick Ueno out of the former video editing room (the cave) to install the PS2 graphics evaluation board. Ueno moved to sit next to Hisashi. Kume will set it up tomorrow, and we should be able to see the demo then.

## November 13, 1998 (Friday)

Kume set up the PS2 evaluation graphics board, and we had video output within five minutes. But the sample footage was nothing more than a simple 8-polygon cube—much simpler than what I had expected. Takabe-kun will hopefully figure something out over the weekend.

I wasn’t able to make any progress on the project proposal today because of meetings.

## November 16, 1998 (Monday)

I went to the hospital for the first time in a month. After waiting for 30 minutes, I finally met the doctor again. When I said, “I'm healed!” he looked genuinely happy.

As I walked the narrow, winding road to the station, which I'd taken so many times over the past six months, I felt a sense of nostalgia. I passed through the ticket gate, silently wishing, “May I never have to come back here. May I stay healthy.” Goodbye to this long battle with illness...

At the secret lab, Takabe-kun’s weekend work was unveiled. He actually spent the entire weekend at the office, staying overnight. The result? 500 Snake models running around in a metal warehouse. The impact was exactly what we were aiming for! It was incredible. This confirms what *MGS2* is all about—numbers. A completely new experience no one has seen before. “This can work!” The team was convinced. If we use mid-poly models, we could probably push it to around 200 characters. I came up with the idea of having 200 soldiers standing in formation during the aircraft carrier sequence, listening to a commander’s speech. Seeing that many characters on screen right from the start would immediately create more tension during the infiltration.

We added a “No Entry” sign and a “P4” label to the secret lab as a joke. It’s become something to look forward to every morning.

Dewa-kun returned from Dallas with samples of the *MGS* trading cards. They turned out great. I’m really satisfied with the result. Thank you, Dewa-kun.

It seems the airstrikes on Iraq have been avoided. The Iraq nuclear inspection issue is part of the backdrop for *MGS2.* There’s suspicion that a Metal Gear is being developed in Iraq… history just keeps repeating itself.

## November 17, 1998 (Tuesday)

Returned to the draft proposal again. Wrote the usual preamble, but whether it will be useful or not, well, not really. Anyway, without some kind of written document to unify our intentions, nothing can start.

Today's menu at Takabe's Secret Research Lab: First thing in the morning, we watched the 300-person Snake scene with anti-aliasing and distance fog. It looks quite good. After that, we looked at surface fog and motion blur. Finally, multi-view rendering. Surface fog seems usable. The significance of focusing on the floor terrain is becoming apparent.


## November 18, 1998 (Wednesday)

Spent the whole morning and afternoon gathering research materials. There wasn’t much progress on the concept document proposal. I worked on the settings section and had Muraoka-san review about 10 pages of the draft in progress.

Today’s menu at Takabe’s secret lab included light processing and backface culling of polygons. Even though we doubled the number to 600 Snakes, it was clearly too much, so we reduced it to 450 Snakes. Tonight was the first time we encountered this kind of strain. Even the PS2 seems to struggle a bit. For now, it’s just the rendering.

450 characters were writhing around in the Metal Gear storage room—it looked like the Honolulu Marathon. When we get to this number, it truly feels like "a lot!" I asked the staff, "How many do you think there are?" They answered, "1,000!" That made me happy.

The first batch of motion data we recorded last month arrived from IMAGICA. Now we can see Mei Ling’s "dojo sukui" (loach scooping dance).

When I got home, ETV was airing a special on child soldiers. The content was almost exactly what I’d read in this morning’s newspaper—perfect timing. I was thinking of using this for Raiden’s true backstory (setting).

The American phone book I requested from KOA arrived. I immediately searched for "Sarah Connor" and had some fun playing Terminator. I’ll use it when naming characters.

## November 19, 1998 (Thursday)

The large draft proposal is nearly complete. Tomorrow, I’ll finish it up and upload it to the development server. While listening to the staff’s opinions, I moved on to character settings.

Today's menu at Takabe’s secret lab included moving point lights and environment mapping. The movement of multiple point lights looked like a disco. The reflection mapping is similar to what Takabe-kun did on the PlayStation before. It’s still just a faked reflection effect. There wasn’t much surprise today.

Johnny finished working on Mei Ling and has started creating the Snake model for *MGS2.* Mizupin is trying to achieve Shinkawa’s style in the textures, but it’s impossible for the designer alone to make it work, so we’ll aim to recreate Shinkawa’s characters in a realistic way. We’ll abandon the approach of making them resemble actual people.

I’ve been regretting not watching the recent meteor shower. It’s not about the fact that it was a once-in-30-years event or the last chance to see it, but I’m surprised at how uninterested and lazy I’ve become about such things. Shouldn’t I have taken the initiative to show the meteor shower to my son? If I were still a student, I would have definitely stayed up all night, staring at the sky. The Apollo landing, the Soyuz docking, Shuttle launches... Back then, I was more curious and active. Could it be that I’m just getting older?

## November 20, 1998 (Friday)

I signed the mystery cards for the *MGS* trading card set. Due to issues in the printing process, only 50 out of the planned 100 types arrived, and I signed those. The cards were coated with a special finish, making it hard for regular markers to stick, so Dewa-kun ran to Mitsukoshi to buy some new pens.

Shin-chan and I split the signing duties. Shin-chan’s pen flowed smoothly, while my pen pressure was too strong. The difference in our signatures was huge. My signature spread out too much, to the point where the letters were almost crushed and ruined the card’s design. The numbers in “1998,” especially the 9 and 8, were practically unrecognizable. I worried, “The people who get this might be upset!” as I kept signing. Still, the cards turned out great, and Dewa-kun looked really satisfied with his work.

I finished writing the large concept document (preliminary version) and uploaded it to the shared server. Now the key members of *MGS2* can view it. Since I used some Mac-specific characters (like arrows) on my Mac, it seems they won’t display properly in HTML.

Today’s menu at Takabe’s secret lab included deflectable point lights. It’s the same technique that was developed for the PlayStation but ultimately scrapped. Six or seven lights wriggled around on the screen, bending when they hit walls or obstacles. This time, it looks like it’ll work! However, if the lights hit thin walls like a folding screen, they still pass through, so we’ll need to carefully choose where to use it. Since Takabe-kun only worked a half day today, this was the only task completed. It looks like he’ll be working through the weekend. Watching him makes me envy engineers—PS2 really seems like a lot of fun.

I went swimming at the sports club. I swam 12 laps today, but that’s still only 700 meters. Fridays are usually less crowded, but the pool lanes were busy. Christmas songs were playing non-stop in the sauna and throughout the club.

My comment appeared in the movie ad section of the evening edition of the *Asahi Shimbun* for *Dark City.*

“It will undoubtedly go down in the history of sci-fi films.”  
— Hideo Kojima, *Metal Gear Solid* Director/Game Designer

I found it funny how they added “…-san” after my name. Still, it feels good to have done something related to the film industry, even in a small way.

## November 22, 1998 (Sunday)

I bought *The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time* and an N64 at the department store. It’s been over two years since the console’s release, and while I considered buying it many times, I never did because there weren’t any games I wanted to play.

I spotted *Zelda* and the N64 at the store. I took my son to the counter, pretending like he was the one who really wanted it.

When I got home, I set up *Zelda.* I played the Kokiri training stage for a while, but I started feeling sick from the 3D motion. As expected, I’m still not good with 3D games... I bought the console just for this, so I have to see it through no matter what.

Later that night, I watched the NHK special *The Ocean: The Unknown World.* It gave me some ideas for *MGS2.* Apparently, after World War I, there was a German scientist who tried to extract gold from seawater. Today, there’s research underway to extract lithium from seawater.

I wonder if it’s possible to extract plutonium or other nuclear weapon materials from manganese nodules at the bottom of the sea? Though, it sounds far too unrealistic...

## November 24, 1998 (Tuesday)

Day by day, the city is getting dressed up for Christmas. I noticed that our home has also started to show its usual Christmas decorations in the living room and entrance. Since work has settled down this year, I should be able to enjoy Christmas at a slower pace.

I revised the large concept document (preliminary version) and uploaded it to the shared server again. Starting tomorrow, everyone will be able to see the most updated version just by checking it. When I asked the staff for their feedback on the draft, it turned out no one knew the proposal was even available online or that they could read it. After I told them where the file was stored, Johnny and others began reading it. I should get some feedback in tomorrow’s daily report.

Today's menu at Takabe's secret lab: shadows influenced by point lights. The shadows stretch and change shape with the movement of the light, curving around on top of a real round oil drum, and bending when they hit the wall. It’s exactly the shadow processing I’ve been dreaming of. We even got multiple shadows appearing from different light sources...

We’ve managed to get it working. But lately, nothing has really surprised me. It feels like something’s missing. If we keep adding this and that, there’s a risk of weakening the visual impact. Focusing too much on shadows and lighting could reduce the number of soldiers on screen. A more cinematic approach with fewer, more detailed polygons might be easier to understand and more likely to succeed... I’m starting to doubt the direction again.

However, even if we aim for movie-like CG, we won’t be able to create the “experience” (sense of immersion) I want. In the end, it's about content. No matter what anyone says, I’m going to keep going down this path.

I found a nonfiction book called *The Nazi Saboteurs of the Atomic Bomb.* Flipping through it, the codename “Mikkel” caught my eye. I’m not sure what language it’s from, but it seems to mean “Fox.” It was a codename given to operatives involved in special operations against the Nazis. I want the codenames this time (for the protagonist and Black Cell) to be based on weapon names (like Raiden and Fatman). I want to convey the nuance that they are being treated as tools of war rather than as people.

## November 25, 1998 (Wednesday)

Since the day I bought *Zelda*, I haven't turned on the N64 even once. At the company, *Zelda* has become a craze among some people. Even Johnny and Nakamura-kun, who are usually very picky about games, are praising it highly. It seems that Nishimura-kun and Uehara-kun are engrossed in it every day until morning. I'm kind of envious. For someone like me who gets 3D motion sickness, it's a bit daunting to try again.

What everyone says unanimously is how difficult the game is. Right from the beginning (the first boss enemy), it demands high-level action skills. Even Muraoka-san got stuck at the first boss. He was asking Okamura during lunch how to defeat it. As for the puzzles, it seems they're so challenging that you absolutely can't solve them without a strategy guide. “That's why it's so satisfying when you figure it out!” That seems to be what everyone who played *Zelda* finds enjoyable. “A game with real substance—it’s been a while since we've had a game that feels like a game amid so many easy ones lately. Because it's difficult, you get a genuine sense of playing the game when you overcome it. Recently, games have been playing us. This is what a game should be...” That's what they all say.

Certainly, the fun of action games lies there. It's also the issue I struggled with until the end when adjusting the difficulty of *MGS.* Why did I worry? Because it's clearly a different era now compared to when *Metal* was released on the MSX. Prices, global affairs, users, and values have all changed. That's why I was so conflicted.

When I talk to various people, it seems that *MGS* overlaps quite a bit with *Zelda* in terms of content and ideas. When you thoroughly pursue 3D polygon action, do you end up reaching the same conclusions?

I worked on the character setting for Raiden, the protagonist. I uploaded almost the first draft to the server. I also wrote the item box entries and uploaded them.

Today's menu at Takabe's secret lab: multiple water ripples. By processing the surface in an environment mapping style, it seems we've achieved CG quality from some years ago. Well, perhaps it's amazing just to be able to render this on actual hardware.

## November 26, 1998 (Thursday)

I did an interview for a French magazine. The writer was fluent in Japanese, so I didn’t need Scott’s help. Unusually, he didn’t record the conversation and just took notes, but it seemed like the subtle nuances didn’t quite come across. When I mentioned that I liked French cinema and Enki Bilal, it seemed to please him. Is that really all it takes?

I took him to the sound department to let him listen to the French voice-over for the scene where Wolf dies. He was really impressed with the performance. After hearing the voice acting, he kept saying, “Congratulations!” over and over for some reason.

Apparently, he’d read somewhere that I like wine, so he brought a bottle of rosé from France as a gift. That was thoughtful of him.

We finalized some details about the setting of Arsenal Gear and Solidus’ goals. I bought some pearl blue and pearl purple pens. There were a lot of interruptions today, so I couldn’t make much progress on the project.

Takabe’s secret lab is on hold today because the German version is in a crunch. It feels lonely...

## November 27, 1998 (Friday)

Today is the release date of the Dreamcast.

I worked on the character settings for Solidus. To avoid making Solidus an absolute villain, I decided to introduce a group of elderly people called “The Patriots,” who secretly control national defense.

I realized today that I had been misunderstanding the meaning of “SOLIDUS” up until now. When I checked with Okaji, it turns out it refers to the phase boundary where something is neither water nor ice. I'll be changing the associated imagery and lines. Apparently, it refers to the curve that shows the relationship between the melting point and the composition of the solid phase—a solidus line.

Just before leaving, I watched *Godzilla* on the Dreamcast. It actually looks pretty interesting. The backgrounds, textures, and camera work are a bit off, but if done properly, it could have been quite good. Ifukube's music is awesome.

The third stage takes place in Osaka, Umeda. I watched as nostalgic landmarks like Hankyu, Hanshin, Maru Building, and the Fourth Building were destroyed by Godzilla. I asked Shin-chan to destroy KCE Osaka, but we couldn’t find the building. At least Konami Osaka got destroyed.

## December 1, 1998 (Tuesday)

I read an article in *Military Research* about Admiral Boorda, the 25th Chief of Naval Operations and a proponent of the Arsenal Ship concept. Rising from the ranks of a sailor, he seems to have embodied the American Dream among a navy full of elites. It seems only someone like him could have thought up the idea of the Arsenal Ship. If ships like the Arsenal spread, the navy’s role would diminish. It also went against the Navy spirit and was seen as an unappealing idea. He faced heavy criticism from elite officers like aviators and submariners. In *MGS2,* I’ll set it up so that the Marines take over the Arsenal Ship project.

I began preparations for tomorrow's PS2 presentation. I arranged the tables in the seminar room and set up the venue. I also ordered signs from Kyu-chan to guide people to the restrooms and vending machines. Honestly, we could charge an entry fee for this.

According to the email tally, there will be 20 people at tomorrow’s presentation. Thanks to everyone for the hard work.

It took almost all day to fit the explanatory VTR into an 8mm tape. I cut the footage into 1-minute sections, with looping visuals in between. During these sections, Takabe-kun will provide commentary.

In the evening, we held a rehearsal in the seminar room. Since the screen was dim, we turned off the lights. The large screen had great impact, but through video, details like anti-aliasing were hard to notice.

I used Okaji to test the reaction from a general audience. He was astonished by the 450 Snakes and let out a shriek. It was a success. I’m debating whether to show it to the *MGS2* team tomorrow. In any case, other departments at KCE will see it tomorrow.

I really want to ask Kyle Cooper to make the title sequence for *MGS2.* He worked on *Eraser,* *Mission: Impossible,* and *Twister*... now that I think of it, they all had that Kyle Cooper style. I have a newfound appreciation for his talent. I’ve set my heart on asking him.

Kyle was born in August 1963, the same year and month as me. Same star sign, same fate. The materials Kyu-chan gave me included the address, phone number, and contact info for his company, Imaginary Forces. I’ll try reaching out after the new year.

I want to attempt the first-ever real-time title sequence in the industry. If that’s not possible, I’m fine with a movie sequence. The Kyle Cooper-style title is already playing out in my head. What I really want to try is a real-time opening credit sequence. I’m not sure if it’s possible, but I have a few ideas.

## December 2, 1998 (Wednesday)

At 10:30 AM, we gathered the main members of the *MGS2* team in the seminar room for a PS2 briefing rehearsal. This was the first unveiling of the PS2 to the team. In about 15 minutes, Takabe-kun finished his explanation, and we showed the PS2 demo video. I asked for their thoughts, but it didn’t seem to make that much of an impact. Compared to the PS and Dreamcast, the general impression was just that it could handle a large number of polygons. Perhaps the anticipation was so high because it had been so difficult to see the PS2 until now, and they had overreacted in their minds.

According to Uehara-kun, it's an amazing piece of hardware. Even so, Toyopee was pleased with it. That’s right—this kind of positive attitude feels refreshing right now.

At 2:00 PM, we held the PS2 briefing. We pushed right up to the last minute to get footage ready of five Metal Gear units plus five Snake units. When the legs of the Metal Gears appeared, they really did look big. I felt like we could pull this off.

As expected, there were a lot of unfamiliar faces. We started the briefing five minutes late.

With Uehara-kun's relaxed atmosphere and tone, he explained the PS2 specs. Honestly, no matter how many times I hear it, I still don’t really understand it. The audience's reaction was strangely quiet. If this had been a school lesson, they definitely would have fallen asleep. I felt a sense of alienation, like I didn’t belong there. Maybe this profession isn’t right for me.

Finally, we got to the explanation of the GS (Graphics Synthesizer), using the video. The lights dimmed, and the video started. The SCE logo and PS mark appeared... “Damn, this isn’t landing!” No one laughed. The opening had clearly failed.

When the footage of 450 Snakes appeared, there was an audible gasp from the audience, but the reaction still wasn’t as big as I’d expected. After the video, we split the attendees into groups of six and took them into individual rooms in the secret lab to see the live footage on the actual hardware.

Since individual hardware viewings were inefficient, we changed the schedule and moved into a Q&A session. Uehara-kun answered politely. By that point, I had no idea what was going on. He was throwing out equations and numbers with a smile, but I had no clue what was supposed to be funny.

I got an email from Scott informing me that *MGS* was selected as “Game of the Year” by *Official PlayStation Magazine.* Wait, what? Where’s *Zelda*? That thought crossed my mind, but then I remembered this was *PlayStation Magazine.*

Shin-chan bought a comic book magazine that had a full-page ad for the *MGS* action figures from McFarlane Toys, set to release in February next year.

Yoshiike-kun rented the video *Eyes Without a Face* for me. I half-jokingly said, “Watch it because it’s scary!” but it seems he took me seriously and rented it. It’s a French film I saw as a kid that scared me intensely.

## December 4, 1998 (Friday)

In the morning, I worked on writing the concept document for *Z.O.E.* In the afternoon, I had a meeting with Okamura based on the concept document to discuss the direction.

After finishing up *Z.O.E,* I finally participated in the VR evaluation session for *Integral.* It was already past 3 PM. We went through Sneaking, Weapon, Advanced, and Special modes in that order. As expected, the Weapon mode is the most fun. Shooting at targets and enemies is a fundamental part of a game. Watching the Nikita missile's first-person view made me feel a bit motion sick. We left a few Special stages unfinished and called it a day.

The stages themselves are fine, but we need to be careful with camera and placement adjustments.

I went swimming at the sports club. Since it’s Friday, it was pretty empty.

## December 6, 1998 (Sunday)

I went with my son to the Transportation Museum in Akihabara.

On the third floor of the museum, we saw a model of the world’s largest tanker. While looking at it, I imagined Snake moving around, thinking about a tanker scenario. However, it’s highly impractical for him to infiltrate a moving tanker from underwater. Looking at models like this helps put things in perspective. The scale is different from what I had imagined. Would Snake have to sneak in by blending in with some cargo? But that wouldn’t feel very Snake-like.

Dropping onto the deck with a stealth parachute in a violent storm might also be too impractical.

## December 7, 1998 (Monday)

I went to Cinema Rise with Muraoka-san to watch *Velvet Goldmine.* Hmm... it was gross. I feel like young people might watch this movie and mistakenly think glam rock is gay music. Even so, Ewan McGregor’s portrayal of Iggy Pop is way too fat.

## December 8, 1998 (Tuesday)

In the morning, I evaluated the remaining VR stages (Special). The "Yamashita Stage" has a bad reputation among the staff, but it's actually well thought out as a stage. The issue isn't the puzzle-solving aspect, but rather the fact that the solution is vague. The answer isn't clear. I'd like to add stages with puzzle elements that require more brainpower, not just technique. I worked on writing the VR disc specifications.

Mineshi is creating the background for the ninja stage. Since the evaluation for *Z.O.E* is tomorrow, I spent most of my time over in that area. As a result, I couldn’t make any progress on the *MGS2* planning today either.

The Mei Ling model for the survival photo shoot was displayed. It didn’t seem very lifelike, so I asked them to apply environmental mapping to the eyes. I wasn’t expecting much, but... this is good! They look a bit like doll eyes, but I feel like some light has broken through. This direction seems promising. While it doesn’t look entirely human, it gives off the sense of a different kind of life. If we tone down the alpha blend of the environmental mapping a bit, it might create a nice moistness in the eyes. Encouraged by this, I asked them to make a separate model for the lower lip and apply environmental mapping to it as well. If this works, the lips could shine like in a cosmetics commercial. I also plan to have them apply environmental mapping to the teeth in *MGS2.* After all, the life of a doll is in its eyes and mouth.

Okajii's eye movement program was implemented, making Mei Ling’s eyes move in an unnatural way. Going forward, we’ll need data to specify the gaze direction along with the motion data. It might be best to link the gaze with the motion to some extent and specify it when creating the demo. This might make demo creation more of a hassle.

I want the enemy soldiers to react to Snake’s weapons and equipment. I’m also thinking of events where they follow his line of sight.

I asked myself: How do things look natural? Naturally, skin and clothing have different materials and colors, so in the real world, they reflect light differently. The reflectivity is different. Black objects absorb light. In other words, in nature, the appearance of things varies depending on their color and material. This is because each has a different level of reflectivity. Current CG doesn’t reflect this. No matter how much we try to work textures into the model, skin, clothes, and buttons all reflect light the same way. As a result, they end up looking like the paper assembly kits that come as extras in Gakken’s *Science and Learning* magazines. If we could selectively turn shading on and off for different parts, we could create a more convincing effect. Ideally, I’d like to have subtle differences in reflectivity rather than just on/off shading, but none of the programmers seemed enthusiastic when I mentioned it.

There’s one more challenge for today: wrinkle representation. Should we simulate wrinkles physically, or should we prepare texture-based illustrations of wrinkles and use morphing techniques? Toray has apparently developed a cloth simulator for clothing design that calculates the wrinkles and draping of fabric based on the selected material for the model. Of course, it’s not in real-time.

It seems that Synergy Geomatics has gone bankrupt. I read an article about it in a newspaper column. It’s a bit of a shock. Back in the days of the PC-98 and 3DO, Synergy was a giant in the multimedia world.

I went swimming at the sports club. The Bee Gees’ *Massachusetts* was playing.

## December 9, 1998 (Wednesday)

I worked on writing the specifications for the VR disc. Using the models and motions from the photo shoot, I created the polygon cutscene for the opening.

We displayed the Mei Ling model for the render evaluation on the PS2. As expected, the high resolution makes it look beautiful. Even the bangs look convincingly like hair. However, it doesn’t feel surprising. Since the textures come through so clearly, adding any touch-ups or stylization might not be a good idea. 

Since the hardware doesn’t support bump mapping, it might be more effective to create details with polygons and use lighting for shading. We might need to hire a lighting specialist. On the PS2, modeling is key. You tend to rely on textures to compensate, but that won’t cut it here.

## December 10, 1998 (Thursday)

Mouri-san came to the office, and I confirmed his willingness to participate in *MGS2.* It seems that Mouri-san wants to contribute to the scenario, but since *Metal Gear* is, after all, a "game," we’ll handle the scenario internally. As long as *MGS2* is a game, the narrative has to be tied to game mechanics. That part can’t be entrusted to someone else. Like in the previous game, Mouri-san will focus on being an advisor. His main responsibilities will include checking the plot and settings, and supervising the tactics and behavior of enemy soldiers. Of course, we also plan to rely on Mouri-san’s connections for research.

Since the release of *MGS,* Mouri-san has been flooded with offers from the game industry, most of which are requests for him to write scenarios. I emphasized again that, like before, his involvement would be broad but not too deep this time. It’s a somewhat difficult request, but Mouri-san seemed happy to accept it. Around March, when the game’s overall structure becomes clearer, we’ll negotiate again, have him check things over, and exchange opinions.

The PocketStation arrived at the company today. Just this morning, I heard the news that its release had been delayed from December 23 to the end of January. Holding it in my hands, I find it incredibly cute and cool at the same time. It’s a wonderful design. I hadn’t been that interested before, but now that I’ve seen it, I want one. It's not about the functionality—it’s the design alone that’s enough of a reason to buy it. Even the back is refined, and it has a high-end feel. It works as a fashion item. It wouldn’t be strange to see a girl wearing one around her neck.

As I fiddled with the real thing, ideas started pouring out like a fountain. The PocketStation is that kind of item. Just holding or looking at it is fun. Since infrared is a concept that hasn’t existed in game consoles before, there are new possibilities. I urgently wrote the specifications for PocketStation integration in the *Integral* version. We’ll proceed with the original plan of the "Ring Project." Since the programming is in assembly, I’ll leave it to Okajii. The pixel art will be handled by the master dot artist Nakamura-kun.

The PocketStation events I thought of today, like the Stan Bralley and Shibuya events, are something I want to bring to life one day.

At the "2nd Agency for Cultural Affairs Media Arts Festival," hosted by the Agency for Cultural Affairs, we won the Excellence Prize in the Digital Art Interactive Division. I received notice of the award from the CS division. At first, I thought we had won the Grand Prize, but after carefully reading the email, it turned out to be just the Excellence Prize. As expected, the Grand Prize will likely go to *Zelda.*

Mei Ling is now properly displayed on the PS2. But even with the proper display, there’s nothing particularly special about it. It looks incredibly ordinary. It feels like a PC game screen. Creating a polygon demo at this level of quality is tough. I need to think of something.

## December 11, 1998 (Friday)

On the PS2, Mei Ling's model has been updated with eye blinking, an eye movement program, and a moisture effect through environmental mapping. However, the polygon edges on the jawline have become noticeable. I had them try applying some blur and smoothing effects. It looks decent. When you add a lot of blur, it creates a soft-focus-like effect. The neck polygons stand out, so I had them add bones to the neck and asked them to look into whether we can split the polygons only when it bends unnaturally. In any case, everything will be determined through future experiments.

I’ll have Shin-chan work on the mecha design for *Z.O.E* within this month. As for Mizupin and Johnny, I’ll have each of them make a model of Snake in their own interpretation.

I watched *Snake Eyes* at Buena Vista in Roppongi. It felt like a typical De Palma movie since *Raising Cain.* However, I couldn’t understand the meaning of the red stone embedded in the pillar at the end. It’s bothering me, but I don’t feel like watching it again.

There was an article about *MGS* in *US TODAY.* It was full of praise. Also, we received the results of an American market survey where *MGS* ranked a proud 2nd place in the “games people want for Christmas.” 1st place was *Zelda.*

I swam at the sports club. It was empty. Fridays seem to be the best time. They were playing nostalgic Christopher Cross songs.

I watched episode 4 of the NHK special *Money Revolution.* Apparently, an artificial stock market using AI traders was developed at the Santa Fe Institute near the Los Alamos National Laboratory. It was created by geniuses classified under complex systems: John Holland and Brian Arthur. It simulates the stock market in a virtual space, similar to earthquake prediction. The name of this project is the Santa Fe Artificial Market. 

For *MGS2,* I plan to expand on this and have Solidus predict the destruction of Wall Street. There will also be an episode where Otacon uses this virtual simulation to profit from trading.

## December 14, 1998 (Monday)

I officially commissioned Shin-chan to design the mechs for *Z.O.E.* We adopted the mecha settings from the doujinshi (fan magazine) Shin-chan wrote back in his student days. For now, since I want to see the silhouette, I gave a provisional order to Kobayashi-kun. After all, it’s a design from six years ago. We’ll refine it. I believe the six-year time gap will work in our favor, like fashion trends.

The protagonist’s mech will have a face embedded in the head. When the face guard opens, it will reveal a demonic expression, just like *Devilman.* The face will be unveiled at the end. The enemy mechs will have skulls. Since the cockpit is positioned in the groin area, I’ve asked for a "Dick Seat" that can erect (stand up). I want to incorporate this into the world’s lingo, so they’ll say things like, "Aim for the enemy’s weak spot (dick)!" Additionally, robots that have been in space for a long time will be parasitized by spaceship lice and Martian barnacles, which will appear to have colonized them. As the robots walk, the lice will fall out of the colony like droplets. When Shin-chan and I get involved, the game clearly heads in a different direction. However, I can feel a certain energy taking shape. I prepared the project proposal for *Z.O.E.*

A box of *MGS* trading cards arrived. Since there weren’t enough for the entire staff, we’ll hold a lottery. Still, only one die-cut card came out of the pack… that must make it quite valuable.

Mei Ling’s neck was fixed. Environmental mapping was applied to the lower lip as well. As expected, it looks quite good.

## December 17, 1998 (Thursday)

At 7 a.m., I turned on the TV and saw the news that the UK and the US had bombed Iraq. This was a military response by the US to Iraq's refusal to allow nuclear inspections. The airstrike occurred without international consent and lasted for six hours. There were images of craters created by the bombing in Baghdad and injured people receiving treatment in bed.

I was deeply shocked. It reminded me of the Gulf War in 1991. At that time, I watched the news about the airstrikes at work. This morning’s first report also featured similar green-tinted night vision footage. It gave me a very grim feeling. Can conflict really not be avoided? It’s the same cycle repeating. What is the UN doing?

I’m concerned about the scale of this conflict. Will it drag on? Will it expand? It seems Clinton is determined to completely crush Hussein.

If the conflict escalates, drags on, and turns into a full-scale war, the development of *MGS2* may have to be scrapped. I feel a deep sense of sorrow. Even if the conflict remains limited, we would still have to change *MGS2's* scenario. The content is just too sensitive.

The story takes place in the near future of the 21st century, where suspicions arise about Metal Gear development in Iraq. The UN demands inspections, but Iraq refuses, and the inspection team, which begins forced inspections, is taken hostage by Iraq. The story starts with tensions rising between Iraq and the US. It’s not just timely—it’s almost identical to real events. If this actually happens in reality, it would rob the fiction of its value and entertainment meaning. If a real meteor were heading toward Earth, no one would go to see *Deep Impact* or *Armageddon.* Moreover, from an ethical standpoint, it would be inappropriate to make light of real-world events in a game.

The story of *MGS* can only exist in a world where peace prevails.

The name "Operation Desert Fox" also reminds me of *MGS.* There are even rumors that stealth and bunker buster bombs were used. It’s extremely unpleasant and regrettable.

I received a box of *MGS* trading cards. I’ll open one pack each day.


## December 24, 1998 (Thursday)

It’s Christmas Eve. We already celebrated Christmas at home yesterday, so today feels like any other day. But as usual, there's a tense atmosphere at the office. Sure enough, someone angrily scrawled in their daily report, "I wish everyone would just die at this time of year…."

Judging by their outfits, it doesn’t seem like the women have any date plans tonight either. At this rate, they won’t last in the entertainment industry, where the job is to bring joy to others.

I started drafting the experiment plan for *MGS2.* I want to move forward with the experiments while juggling work on the European version and *Integral.* But nothing compares to the happiness and excitement I feel when thinking about systems—it makes me eager to start experimenting.

Thinking about how good the first-person view felt in *Integral,* I’m sure first-person attacks will become a core feature in *MGS2.*

Merry Christmas...

## January 7, 1999 (Thursday)

It’s my first diary entry in two weeks. I’ve been so busy over the year-end and New Year’s period that I couldn’t find the time to write after coming home. Habits are scary—once you slack off, you tend to be lazy the next day too. Before I knew it, I hadn’t written for over two weeks. That was close. If this keeps up, I might stop writing my diary altogether…

Starting today, I’m finally back to working on *MGS2* after several months. It’s been so long that I’ve forgotten the plot. This is bad.

I worked on fleshing out the boss battles and character settings. Recently, I’d been worrying, "Am I getting too old for this?" But ideas and visuals came flooding in one after another. Especially when I started writing out the rough script for the boss battles, the ideas just wouldn’t stop. The imagery kept expanding in my mind. It was fun. I was impressed with myself. It’s been a while since I’ve felt impressed by my own talent. It seems I’ve still got it.

However, there are too many characters and the twists are too complicated, so I need to simplify it a bit more. Personally, I don’t think a game needs a complex story, but considering the expectations of players from the previous game, it seems one of *MGS's* main attractions is its story. This is something I find hard to understand myself. But when I read comments like, "The plot twists were great!" or "I hope the next one surprises us even more!" I realize those elements are necessary.

I might scrap the boss character "Old Man." Tomorrow, I’ll make a list and try to balance it with the previous game.

On the way home, I found myself fixated on the idea of including a female ninja. There are at least three characters from the previous game that players would project onto a female ninja: Meryl, Naomi, and Wolf. Any of these characters could work as the ninja in this game, but none of them really fit. It would take the story too far off track. Originally, I thought about bringing back Ocelot in a powered exoskeleton, but visually, a female ninja with a prominent chest just looks better.

Today’s conclusion is to consider a female ninja character that doesn’t directly relate to any of the three mentioned. The idea is to introduce a female ninja as part of the S3 Plan, who assists Raiden. This would help bring Raiden’s experience closer to Snake’s. I’ll hire three voice actresses and use digital tricks to change the voice in different scenes.

In Honolulu, I watched a Magic Polynesian Show. It was an old-school fire dance mixed with magic, a modern version of a Polynesian show. As expected from the entertainment capital, America. At first, I was skeptical, but it was quite impressive.

After seeing that magic show, I suddenly felt a strong urge to include a magician as a boss enemy. I imagine a scene where the magician pulls out an empty box, covers it with a cloth, and then, to everyone’s surprise, removes the cloth to reveal enemy soldiers pouring out of the box. I ran the idea by a few of the staff, but it wasn’t well-received.

For the first time in years, I bought a copy of *Eureka.* It’s almost entirely a special issue on Paul Auster. It looks like it’s packed with good content. I want to finish reading *The Locked Room* soon. I decided to name Raiden’s real name "Fanshawe." I also want to use the name "Quinn," the protagonist of *City of Glass,* somewhere in the game.

I was shown the latest character model from Mizupin. The shoulder, waist, and toe structures have improved significantly. Now we just need to figure out what to do about the hair.

A nasty cold is spreading through the office. Shin-chan hasn’t shown up since the start of the year. I started feeling unwell too, so I bought some liquid cold medicine from the pharmacy and took it. I went home early.

## January 11, 1999 (Monday)

Today, I worked on my manuscript for *Game Critique* titled "Snake Eyes and De Palma." It’s been several weeks since I saw the movie, so I don’t remember much about it. Well, I did watch it a second time on a plane around the end of the year, so maybe it’s not that bad. Still, forgetting what I originally wanted to write about is frustrating, to say the least. In the end, I couldn’t write a very good manuscript to kick off this year. It’s hard to call it a good start. Yesterday, my son and I both drew "Double Great Fortune" at the shrine, but perhaps it’s not as reliable as I thought. Or maybe it’s a bad omen after all.

I had planned to scrap the "Old Man" character, but this morning, Hirano-kun brought me some settings and reference materials. The content is so dense that I can’t use it as-is, but there are some interesting parts. The idea of having him attack with two young girls (Valkyries) is ethically impossible. Could "Old Man" make a comeback?

Shin-chan came to the office for the first time this year. Come on, Yoji Shinkawa, get in better shape!!!

I handed over the draft and character settings for *MGS2.* *Z.O.E.* is on hold for now. I asked them to compile the rough sketches we’ve done so far into a file. We held a design research meeting for *MGS2,* with Mizupin at the center. We want to decide on the direction before the CPU arrives. We need to settle on whether to go with Shin-chan’s style, BD’s style, or Johnny’s style. Personally, I don’t want to rely on hand-drawn textures. I’d prefer to use raw materials and emphasize the lighting to bring them to life. I also want the faces to be composed of flat surfaces, where shadows and lighting recreate the sense of depth and contours. I’m aiming for something that clearly sets itself apart from the current standard of CG rendering.

The cold came back again. This time, I bought two bottles of Kakkonol liquid from the pharmacy and chugged them. I must have looked unwell because the guy at the register gave me some powdered vitamin C. It warmed my heart, somehow.

On the way home, I bought a commuter pass. It’s for three months, so it’s good until April 10. Whenever I buy a pass, I imagine the time when it expires and fantasize about all sorts of things: Will the development be finished by then? Will I still be with the company? Will I even still be alive by then?

There was a copy of Paul Auster's new book *The Music of Chance* on Mineshi's desk.

I asked, "How did you get this?" to which he casually replied, "I bought it because I liked the cover illustration." When I asked, "Was it good?" he said, "I haven’t read it." What? Did he really buy a hardcover book just for the cover and then not read it? Paul, you deserve better than this...

I read the January issue of *Eureka,* the special issue on Paul Auster, but since I have no knowledge of contemporary American literature, I could barely understand anything. I felt like a total idiot.

## January 12, 1999 (Tuesday)

I worked on the *MGS2* project, adding details to Fortune's character and the boss battles. Matsuka is organizing the weapons and equipment based on the notes from the training camp.

It seems like Shin-chan's character designs are progressing well. Today, he was drawing Fortune. I don’t think there’s much to worry about.

I asked Kume-chan to buy *Half-Life* for reference for *MGS2,* since it was selected as Game of the Year by *EDGE.* While the graphics are somewhat underwhelming, the gameplay and attention to detail are astounding. Once again, I felt that sense of "We’ve been outdone by the Americans!" Most of all, the atmosphere is incredible. The real-time direction is superb, and you can feel the soul of the creators in the game. The sequence where dimensions shift during the lab accident gave me goosebumps. 

Japanese blockbuster games lack this kind of soul. While it's not an especially groundbreaking game, its careful attention to detail, direction, and mechanics is more than enough to build a compelling game world. Everything in the game can be destroyed, bullet holes appear, and when you throw wooden crates or barrels into the river, they float. Even the demo emphasizes freedom, and it feels like an interactive version of *MGS's* polygon demo! However, this method wouldn’t work for a story-heavy game like *MGS.*

Also, *Half-Life* has a training mode called "Hazard Course." This was originally introduced by *Tomb Raider,* but it seems to have become standard in modern PC games. I had been thinking about removing VR mode from *MGS2,* but now I’m reconsidering.

I went swimming at the sports club. Since I’m still recovering from my cold, I did five laps and then got out. Even that tired me out.

## January 13, 1999 (Wednesday)

Once again, a first for the industry—a new system is born! This will probably be something we could patent. How can we overcome the non-interactive downtime in polygon demos? This has always been the biggest barrier and problem when trying to merge gameplay with story. In a complex narrative structure like *MGS2,* the real-time method used in *Half-Life* would cause the story to be lost on the user. 

That’s when I came up with today’s idea: the split-screen polygon demo. At certain points in the game, the screen would be split. On one side, the traditional polygon demo plays out, and on the other, the game continues as normal. The split could be either horizontal or vertical, depending on the scene. This method would be perfect for simultaneous events or background developments, such as the classic "Meanwhile, elsewhere..." moments where the protagonist isn’t involved. For example, in a scene where three people are disarming bombs at the same time, this would massively increase the tension. The story would unfold on-screen while the gameplay continues, creating freedom and allowing the player to see the narrative. Maybe watching *Snake Eyes* really paid off.

I changed the setting of the old security guard character. Since the other characters are quite complex, I’m going to make him much more straightforward. Instead of being a former terrorist, he’ll be a former NYPD bomb disposal advisor, a desk worker. He’s not a terrorist, but a man who, after more than a decade on the job, made a mistake while disarming a bomb, which led to his retirement. I’ll base this character on Ed from *Policenauts.* I also want to see Iizuka-san.

After a long time, I resumed experiments on the P4 system today. This time, it’s character experiments. We’re testing toon shading-like rendering on real hardware. The idea is to treat areas under a certain light threshold as shadows, filled in with flat shading. In practice, we’re drawing the model twice, which requires double the calculations. The goal is to achieve the texture and feel of anime cels. Ultimately, we’re aiming for a touch like BD’s or the style of Shinkawa’s illustrations.

In the first test, I rendered Mei Ling, but depending on the angle, it looks quite harsh. However, the legs look very close to a cel-like appearance, likely because the texture on them is quite flat. For the lit areas, I’m applying smooth shading. In the current state, I added an additional layer for highlights. The brightest areas are flat-filled with white, and alpha blending is applied. Next, I’ll use two stages of shadows and shift them slightly. This gives a kind of blurry effect. Anti-aliasing would normally fix this, but with the current approach, it can’t be applied.

Overall, it’s not bad for the first day. But even so, this method is consuming three times the processing power of normal polygon rendering. I wonder what will happen once we add split-screen, shadow processing, and real-time shading on top of this...

Mizupin showed me a model that now has polygonal shading integrated. It looks pretty promising. If we combine this model with the pseudo-toon shader we experimented with the other day, it might just work.

The environment-mapped shadows appeared on Johnny’s new Snake model. It’s not particularly impressive, but with some tweaks, it could work. However, the visuals don’t have any noticeable impact. The shadow boundaries are smoothed with anti-aliasing, but there’s an issue with the shadows glitching at the connecting polygons. We’ll need to find a fix for that.

The approval for the French version from SCEE has come in. Now, we’re just waiting for the Italian version. The initial run for the English, German, and French versions is 770,000 units. If we add in the reorders from Italy and America, we’ll reach our goal of 3 million units this fiscal year! The Spanish version will be treated as a bonus. I’m especially happy that we’ve been recognized by users around the world.

I went swimming at the sports club. Since I’m still feeling under the weather, I only did five laps again.

Once again, we’ve come up with a first in the industry. The name? **"Real-Time Revelation"** system. In *MGS2's* grand finale, the entire sequence where secrets are revealed will be portrayed in real time, with characters pointing guns at each other the whole time. It’s the kind of tense situation we’ve seen in Quentin Tarantino or Ringo Lam movies, where more than three characters are all pointing guns at each other, unable to move.

In *MGS2,* the characters constantly switch sides. So, while they have guns aimed at each other, the revelations keep coming, new characters join the scene, and each time the story takes a dramatic twist, the characters shift who they are pointing their guns at.

For example, a new character might say, *"Snake was actually the enemy..."* and everyone changes where they’re aiming. Then Snake says, *"No, I was only pretending to be the enemy. It was all Solidus's plan..."* and the targets shift again. Solidus, Ocelot, Snake, Raiden, Fortune, and Sergei will all have their guns pointed at different people as the truth keeps changing.

This will happen in real time. The player holds down the weapon button (to keep the gun aimed) while watching the events unfold. Once you aim your gun, you can't release the button until the end. During this time, you can change your target or adjust the camera angle in first-person mode. Flashbacks will be shown in split-screen. Let’s see how this all works out.

To destroy the artificial intelligence of Arsenal (the Patriots), FOXDIE will be used again. Emma’s PAL code is hidden in the rhythm of her heartbeat. When her heart stops, the PAL will be input. Ocelot extracts this information from Emma using a truth serum, which is why he intentionally lets her escape.

The production and shipment numbers for *MGS* are as follows: 756,000 units in Japan, 1.38 million units in America, and 770,000 units in Europe (only in the UK, Germany, and France). We’re still shy of reaching 3 million.

I stopped by a CD store with Muraoka-san and bought OMD’s greatest hits. I remember that at one point, we had planned to use OMD’s hit song *"Enola Gay"* as the ending theme for the previous game. I also remember Muraoka-san stopping me, saying, *"No one from the younger generation knows such an obscure song."*

This morning, I listened to the Bee Gees' greatest hits for the first time in a while, and I almost cried. I guess I’ve reached that age. Maybe I’ll buy Billy Joel’s greatest hits next.

*Half-Life* is really well-made. Its volume is substantial, but what really stands out is the intricate mechanics and the insane, typically American ideas that shine through. In the scene I watched today, you can equip a biological weapon that’s a gun in the shape of a creature, or use a bug-like biological bomb (which looks like an alien bug itself) directly as a weapon. While it’s effective against enemies, if you’re not careful, it can harm the player as well. The motion when holding this biological bomb is also fantastic. It’s not just about having fun; it’s a practical and thoughtful design that you don’t often see in Japanese games. This is a good game, especially as far as Western games go.

It seems that, by global standards, the volume of *MGS2* must surpass that of the previous game. The current plan is already quite ambitious in terms of volume. However, with this being for a new platform, the release date has been set from the start, making it difficult to balance volume and the development timeline.

I’m considering introducing mission selection in the middle of the game, allowing for branching paths. Should Snake and Raiden progress simultaneously, or should the player randomly choose which mission to pursue? Instead of a traditional selection, the player would decide in real time which mission to go for. The other mission would be handled automatically by Snake.

I’ve decided to change the name of "Old Man" to "Old Boy." The term "Old Boy" not only refers to a cunning old man but apparently also has connotations of the devil.

I went swimming at the sports club but left quickly again. *Point of Impact* is just too interesting. I feel like I’m going to get hooked on Stephen Hunter’s books for a while. On my way home, I bought *Dirty White Boys* at the bookstore near the station.

## January 25, 1999 (Monday)

It's currently 1:30 AM. I missed the last train, so I had to take a different line to get home. I'm glad the rain stopped. Even so, all these drinking parties are exhausting. It feels like my stomach is acting up again, too.

Mizupin is struggling with Shin-chan’s rendering style. I’ll wait and see how it goes for a bit longer, but based on how things looked today, I don’t have much hope. In the end, we might have to go with traditional CG. However, if we do that, we won’t stand a chance.

I bought Jack Finney’s *From Time to Time*. I ran into Nishimura-kun at the bookstore. When I mentioned the book to him, he immediately went to buy it. People from the same generation get it. I also remembered how I couldn’t finish *Time and Again*.

I added more to Old Boy’s setting and the concept for his boss battle. Old Boy’s attack methods will change depending on the weapon the player uses. Programming and balancing this will be tricky.

The first draft of *The Truth of Shadow Moses* is complete. Now I just need to add extra content and lay down the narrative threads. It’s likely going to end up around 300 manuscript pages. The main challenge is figuring out how to get people who don’t like reading to engage with it.

After that, I went to a New Year’s party in Ebisu with Scott, Hattori-san, and others. The participants included President Yoshioka, Matsuka, and Okamura. It was a great place for fish. The sashimi was delicious. Hattori-san was downing sake and got pretty drunk. We then went to karaoke, as has become a routine lately. I heard the *Fantasy of the Universe* song performed by a professional. Karaoke is starting to feel kind of boring.

The *Titanic* theme at the end was nice, though.

## January 26, 1999 (Tuesday)

I’m exhausted today. Since yesterday, I’ve had intense stomach pain, but today it reached its peak. I’m still not feeling well. On top of that, I had severe diarrhea this morning—two days in a row now. After drinking red wine, my stools turn completely black. I wonder if there’s some connection.

Mizupin showed me the experimental video for Shin-chan's style. There are still some concerns, but I’m starting to see potential.

We’re making Arsenal Gear a giant turtle. The challenge is to avoid making it look too cartoonish while still conveying its massive size. I’ve also decided to scrap the boat chase in the finale and instead have the turtle rampage straight into Manhattan.

## January 27, 1999 (Wednesday)

Johnny is working on the second experiment with the CG model. He’s adding teeth to Snake's mouth.

The second batch of Shin-chan’s character sketches has come in. The vampire is no longer a pretty-boy, narcissistic type but has been turned into a hairy man. I’m not sure what to think—what should we do about this?

## January 28, 1999 (Thursday)

I’m converting the remaining character settings into HTML. I’ve upgraded the version of the Word documents to 6.0. By tomorrow, I plan to finish all the character settings. Next month, I’ll need to write the project plan for the Game Boy Color version of *MGS*.

I watched the ending of *Half-Life*. It really felt like watching a movie. The scenes near the end were incredible. The world, design, movement, and use of color—all had a very unique feel. The spider-shaped "testicle creature (temporary name)" in particular really struck a chord on a visceral level. It evoked the same kind of revulsion I felt from *The Drifting Classroom*. I wonder what kind of life the creators of this game live.

The final boss was a giant fetus. If I had children, I probably wouldn’t be able to make this kind of character into a boss, but it was undeniably an amazing visual. The scale and direction were excellent, and the fact that they portrayed it in real-time rather than just as a demo was impressive. Even the ending itself was unique. I really want to meet the developers who made this game.

I skipped the sports club today. I feel like I might be catching a cold, so I decided to be cautious.

## January 29, 1999 (Friday)

I stopped by the SGI-hosted conference at Ebisu Garden Hall. I entered the lobby—there were so many people. Maybe it's because admission was free?

Well, the talk from Polygon Pictures' president was interesting, so I’m glad I went. 

He said, *"You can't do what everyone else is doing. Competing on quality alone won’t make you stand out."* It’s a simple truth, but it directly applies to the current direction of *MGS2*.

## February 1, 1999 (Monday)

My Mac at home won't start up. Can't even reset it. The *"Sad Mac"* icon appeared—it’s the first time I’ve seen that icon. When I try to force quit, it makes an alert sound I’ve never heard before.

I have no choice but to take it to the office...

I bought the *Titanic Scenario Photo Book.* As expected, Cameron is amazing. This time too, the making-of and his commentary are more interesting than the movie itself. By coincidence, since the protagonist was also named Jack, I decided to name "her" Rose.

While I'm at it, I'll make Snake’s alias "Plissken." It might be better to be this playful.

I changed Colonel Gurlukovich into a female character. Isn’t it necessary to have a love interest besides "her"?

So, I’ve decided to introduce the colonel’s daughter. She’s a spy for "the Patriots," so she’s on Raiden’s side. I’ll create a situation where Raiden and she absolutely have to fight in front of Solidus. I asked Scott for a name and decided on Olga Gurlukovich. "Olga" is actually taken from the name of a staff member at KOE.

I changed "her" role. Instead of supporting via radio, I’ll set her as an on-site hostage. Raiden will try to rescue her, but they keep missing each other—making it a Gothic romance.

I purchased an English-Japanese slang dictionary to research Dead Cell's codenames. I’ll use expressions other than "taboo" in the American version.

## February 2, 1999 (Tuesday)

I got the *Sad Mac (crying face)* message on my Mac at home, so I reluctantly decided to bring the heavy thing to work. First thing in the morning, I had Kume-chan look at it, and, to my surprise, it worked! He said it might have fixed itself due to the shock of being moved during my commute.

When I muttered, "No way!" he laughed and replied, "That’s just how Macs are." Well, it’s still heavy, but I guess I’ll bring it back home. While I’m at it, I’ll have him upgrade the version of MS Word.

I wrote the draft for *Metal Gear GBC.* It’s just a thin concept document with some basic instructions. Not many ideas are coming to mind. All I can think of are additional features, but I’m struggling to develop the core structure.

I finished the *Tatebayashi* chapter of *Drama Series Vol. 3: Tabidachi no Uta* by the evening. The marathon and essay-writing events don’t quite work as events, but it’s still pretty good. This character doesn’t have the quirks that the others do. She might be the first *Tokimeki Memorial* girl I actually like. I think people who are emotionally invested in the series might cry. It wasn’t as bad as I had feared. Since I’m busy with *MGS2,* I don’t have the time to add extra direction like I did with *Rainbow.*

I bought a history book related to New York. Apparently, there’s a NY boom right now, with a huge number of tourists. Of course, it’s also popular with people from Japan.

I decided on Snake’s fake name. I chose the word for "viper" in Algonquin (Iroquois), a native language from the Manhattan area.

*MGS2* will seriously depict "America," incorporating the history of NY, which is also part of American history. I’ll study up before we go to NY for research.

Scott brought over the European version of *MGS.* The packaging and manual are really stylish. Well done, Europe! We’ve received 870,000 pre-orders.

I finally watched the ending of *Hybrid Heaven.* The final scene was so popular that even the staff gathered like a gallery, and it was a lively event. There’s definitely something charming about this game. No doubt about it. Uehara-kun struggled with the part where you have to fight a chain of bosses without being able to save. The ending was very Hollywood-style. The President’s role was well done.

They’re predicting heavy snow tomorrow.
