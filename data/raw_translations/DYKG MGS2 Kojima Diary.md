Hideo Kojima: 4 years of struggle

1998-2001

\-98/10/6 (Tuesday)

I went to SEGA’s “New Challenge Conference 2”. It seems like this next generation of consoles will be tough for full polygon.

If you’re looking for cinematic visual quality on the DC or PS2, seems like it’s best to avoid full polygon. Ultimately, the impression I got was that for games on PC, the number of polygons has increased to make thinks look a bit prettier, but there are still limits to how detailed things can get. You need to get to the essence of how things are going to look. Looking at these DC games today, I saw the direction of MGS2.

It won’t be cinematic quality. It’s a game at the end of the day, one that prioritizes gameplay and elements that weren’t possible before. Even if that means being low polygon.

Like having dead enemies remain, even 100 of them……

\-98/10/7 (Wednesday)

I went to see Saving Private Ryan with Matsuhana, Nishimura, and Nakamura. We prepared the tickets we’d bought earlier and went off to Shibuto Cine Tower. But we get there, and what do you know, it was already standing room only\! Is it really that popular?

…..and then an announcement that “it’s 1000 yen today”.

I see, so it was Movie Day.

I don’t have the strength to stand for a 3 hour movie, and was giving this look of “what should we do” just as the board on the theatre over yonder caught my eye.

“Austin Powers”.

Right away, we crossed the street in the light rain and switched to Austin Powers.

Daaaaaaang, that was funny. But maybe only people over 30 will get that kind of comedy?

I might need to re-watch 007 again for MGS2’s development.

\-98/10/23 (Friday)

Today was the day of a barium test for my stomach, duodenum, small intestine and large intestine. It appears the KGB would call it “using barium” when they intentionally passed on false information to check for leaks.

I left home 30 minutes later than usual. My son waved from the doorway until I was out of sight. My bags were packed for a 5-night, 6-day business trip, so it was difficult getting to work. I should have at least brought my suits to work the day before.

\-98/10/29 (Thursday)

Did motion capture at IMAGICA. We had a morning meeting, so left some time after 10\. I was guided around Otei capture studio. It’s been 2 years since I’ve been to IMAGICA.

I went when I had just arrived in Tokyo to do some video editing for TGS. I worked with the staff there through the dead of night.

Set up was already finished by the time I arrived.

Toyopi (So Toyota) was front and center handling the captures. We started with Mei Ling. A (texture-less) model of Mei Ling made by Mizupin (Probably Takashi Mizutani) moved in real time matching the actress’ movements.

From a distance, it looks quite realistic.

A magnetic motion capture system was used. There was limited action this time, so we recorded in a small studio.

**The actress was quite a looker. She had also done work as the kids in Silent Hill.** Actions were done 1 per shooting. It was the first time she was directed for each of the actions, so things proceeded with some fumbling around.

Even so, the progress was beyond comparison to what we had tested out 3 years earlier. The programming was good too. I guess it really is impossible to do everything ourselves. We need to think efficiently.

We headed back to Ebisu for a bit in the afternoon before going to IMAGICA again at 5\. Toyopi was well familiarized with everything and was relaxed. We had captured all the shootings we had expected to, so did adlib recording for the remaining 30 minutes. The traditional dancing the actress had learned and the dojou sukui done using Naomi’s file were quite the sight.

We greeted the actress once she’d taken off her motion capture suit and helmet. She was a pretty and cool person. These kinds of jobs may increase in the future.

\-98/10/30 (Friday)

I planned to go to the hospital this morning, but my stomach felt fine, so I decided not to and went to work as usual. I might run out of medicine today.

\-98/10/31 (Saturday)

I bought a GBC and then just set it aside for now. There aren’t any games that I want, so it will probably end up just lying around not being used.

I found the (original) GB Mario in my room. I plugged it into the GB and played it and well, it’s fun. It’s a game at its fundamentals. Only 4 colors and a bit ugly, but still good enough.

Left Ebisu with Muraoka and the sound guy. Arrived at Pantheon around 2:15. Saw that the line for Tokyo Fantastic went from the 1st to the 5th floor. Our sound guy hadn’t left work yet, so I asked some guy I didn’t know (in an Escape from LA hat) to hold seats for us, and he saved a good spot on the 2nd floor. I gave him a Metal Gear hat as thanks. We still had over 4 hours, so I went to Tower Records and a book store with Muraoka. I bought a Dark City CD and a Sniper novel. 

We got back in line again, but it’s quite tough at this age. By coincidence, it turned out that LA guy’s friend was part of Konami group. And he'd brought his girlfriend with him. That made 5 of us in the group. As we got closer to the event starting, the number of TV station cameras there increased. LA guy got caught on camera and did an interview. I don’t know if he lost his mind, but at the end he said “Metal Gear is available now”.

A bit after 5:30, our friend from the sound staff arrived. It was Matsuno, who had made FFT for Square. He was exchanging business cards with people on the stairs like a salaryman. We talked about our recent circumstances as we waited. He’s a real good guy.

Things finally started at 6\. We found our good spot in the 5th or so row from the front. With all the decorations and lighting, it didn’t look like the Parthenon. The opening was spectacular. After a Kungfu action event, they introduced the guests. People like Bruce Lee’s wife, Go Nagai, etc…

Then at 7 it was “Vampires”. It started with an interview video with John Carpenter. He seemed more energetic than before. It was quite a good interview.

Vampire was so good, it felt like Carpenter was really back\! It had good themes. It was a story that had Carpenter written all over it.

Once the movie ended, I went to dinner in Harajuku with Muraoka. We talked about a planning boot camp while drinking beer and I explained the outline of MGS2. Now that I think about it, it was Muraoka that I talked to about the plot of the last one too. It was at a café in Sannomiya station if I recall. Afterwards, we drank until 12 at a bar in Ebisu.

98/11/1 (Sunday)

I saw the news about John Glenn on TV. He’s promised to go with his son to space, but I wonder if he can keep it? He talks about rockets less like the space shuttle and more like the rocket from Wallace and Gromit’s cheese holiday.

I spent the day reading a book at home. I finished Nancy Collins’ “A Dozen Black Roses.”

98/11/4 (Wednesday)

Had an interview with a German TV channel. The interviewer and cameraman brought their equipment in a heavy duralumin case. Both of them looked German. The interviewer had ear piercings, and the other one looked just like Special Agent Mulder from The X-Files (David Duchovny). They looked so alike that I asked Scott (Scott Dolph) to translate that and tell them, but he said they didn’t look alike and he didn’t translate it for me.

I heard that Scott had lived in New York for a bit, and immediately asked him about the area around of Manhattan Island. He told me a bit about the distance from the Statue of Liberty to Wall Street, and the safety and geography of Soho, Chinatown, Little Italy, and Brooklyn. With this much, I should have no problems setting MGS2 in Manhattan. I’ll ask Scott for a detailed map of Manhattan. When I go to New York to gain information, I’ll trust what he says since he’s so familiar with it.

**An armed group takes over the offshore plant (artificial island) that was built after the tanker incident, and since they’re a bit weak, they decide to take the president, who has come to inspect the plant, hostage as well. The president is suddenly killed at the start of the story, and then player expectations are subverted. The president was actually a body double. President Solidus, nearing the end of his term, creates a cover to go underground.**

98/11/8 (Sunday)

Went to work in the afternoon. I was contacted by RMC that there was a freezing bug on the PAL version of MGS. Uehara filled me in on the details. It turned out to be memory overload. At the heliport, if you put on thermal goggles the moment the stinger’s 1st person camera broke, it would freeze. We fixed it for handover to CS international tomorrow. Uehara stayed to burn the ROM. He’s been showing confidence, flexibility, and a sense of responsibility recently. It’s a good thing.

**I borrowed some videos at Tsutaya: “The Guard from Underground” and “Break Down.” I went home, and after putting my son to bed, watched Kurt Russell’s “Break Down”. It was so interesting it gave me strength. Does the sense of tension come from Kurt Russell being a weak, ordinary person? I’ll need to make the protagonist of MGS an ordinary person to create that kind of tension……but that won’t make for a game.**

**At 9pm they were broadcasting John Woo’s “Blackjack”, never before released in Japan. Akio Otsuka did the voice of main character Dolph Lundgren. I might be able to use that sequence where the kid was telling Lundgren where to shoot after he’d been blinded by a flashbang grenade (enemy at 12 o’clock\!). I only watched the beginning then went to sleep.**

There was a big earthquake in the middle of the night. It was a 4 in Kanagawa prefecture, and a 3 in Tokyo. Earthquakes are terrible.

I had a lot of weird dreams.

98/11/9 (Monday)

Had a recording for the MGS radio drama (episode 3\) at Central Recording from 3\. Saka was back to play the role of Colonel Cortez. He really is amazing. It was a realistic performance evocative of Gates Becker. So much so that listening to it feels suffocating.

People from a few different magazines came to report on this or that. Took a commemorative photo with the voice actors at the studio. Otsuka told me “director, please get in the middle”, but we took the photo with me on the very end. It seems Otsuka (voice of Snake) really likes MGS.

**Saka is really great, so I thought about a character for him in MGS2. Had a rambling conversation with Muraoka at a ramen shop in Ginza.**

**A legendary man who worked as a sniper in the Vietnam war, taking out 64 enemies. But actually, he’s not the sniper, but a spotter. He caused that legendary man to miss on his first mission and got him killed. Now he works security at an offshore plant. His beloved wife has passed away, so now he’s devoted to his only son. He then becomes estranged from his son once he finds out about his past.**

**He’s familiar with the interior of the offshore plant. In the end he serves well as a spotter for Snake.**

I tried thinking of a role for Kaneto Shiozawa too, but no good role came to mind.

Saw “the Replacement Killers” in Ginza. I think the same story could have been a lot better if John Woo had made it. Chow Yun-Fat sucked. The gunfights were uninspired. I guess only John Woo can make him look manly.

**Today’s name. Raiden Brannigan**

**Solidus is gas, haze, an existence that doesn’t exist.**

98/11/10 (Tuesday)

Belatedly assembled all the MGS development completion reports. With 39 people in total, it was difficult to get them all together.

I went to Tsutaya with Matsuhana to borrow some development reference materials. I returned “Break Down” and “The Guard from Underground”, and borrowed “Sniper” and “Face/Off”.

**Today’s newspaper had an article about the supercomputer codeveloped by Livermore Laboratory and IBM, Blue Pacific. I wondered what would you even use such a high speed calculator for, and apparently it’s for subcritical experiments. I guess the use of VR in nuclear testing will become more and more prevalent. The Arsenal Gear would also be equipped with 10 supercomputers (Blue Atlantic). I thought of the Arsenal Gear as not just an arsenal, but something that collects its own data, and provides feedback on experiments in order to deploy in the shortest time possible. There wouldn’t be a need for simulated warhead firing exercises. A nuclear test arsenal deployed in actual warfare.**

**I’ll feature a historic warrior using telomeric oxygen to prevent aging. A legendary hero from the second world war. One who even taught Big Boss a lot of strategy. Someone close to 100 years old physically, boasting over half a century of combat experience.**

**Codenamed “Old Man”, a walking piece of military history. He calls all soldiers around the world “youngsters”.**

**“No one has seen more battlefields than me. And no one living has come closer to death than me.” He fights using a panzerfaust. I’ll leave Hirano to figure out the details of his equipment.**

**Saka would be good for his voice.**

While tossing around ideas with Murata on the radio drama, we heard that Kikuko Inoue was coming back. And it appears Akio Otsuka will be appearing in a live action film. We’ll need to pay attention to his scheduling for when he can be MGS2.

\-98/11/11 (Wednesday)

We gathered at CS corporate HQ at 9:30, the heads of each KCE development department for a total of 12 people, and all went to SCE together. We waited in the familiar 1st floor lobby to submit the master.

Then to the meeting room. As we went up the stairs, I saw the floors were clean and the women we ran into were all beautiful and flashed beaming smiles. That’s SCE for you.

**First we went into a small room. We watched 5 different types of demos on 5 prototype PS2 (graphics boards) stacked on top of each other. It was great\! If I was a technical person, I may have been more appropriately shocked. But for someone technology ignorant like me, it wasn’t anything too special. Especially since I heard that the reflection of fireworks bouncing off the floor, the reflection halation, and lens flare were sprites and not calculated based on light source. It surpasses comparison with previous machines, but it’s not like the machine of my dreams or anything like that. And of course, it’s got no smell. Needless to say, no flavor either.**

Finally we saw a model of the GT opening cutscene, an environment flowing in real time. Hmm, that really was great. If made properly, one could comfortably express movie class visuals in real time. You could say it's highly suited for cinematic games. However, MGS is different. This sort of display seems rather unhelpful.

We changed locations, and went from the technology to getting an explanation on the specifications. It’s a monstrously advanced piece of hardware that dispenses with the norms of game consoles. It also changes in the way it processes data. Effects like explosions, wind, and smoke are not crafted by hand, but produced by physics calculations from something called middleware. Things like fire and water exist in real time 3D not as data, but calculations. This is a big change in how things are made. Where before an animator would make every single hair, with the change to physics calculations, things may get closer to photorealism while also losing their distinctiveness.

We brought back 1 set of just the graphics hardware to our company. Had a complex discussion with Uehara in the taxi from Akasaka to Ebisu, I don’t think I’ll forget it.

Once we got back to Ebisu, we got the main members together and explained the outline.

**We reaffirmed our direction with MGS2 would be to have a large number of enemies in low polygon (around 100 soldiers in 1000 polygon-class.)**

\-98/11/12 (Thursday)

**Wrote up a draft of the plans. Had to switch from the more familiar WORDPERFECT to MS-WORD. That’s how the changing of eras goes. The same goes for this diary, but the sensation just feels different. The layout on the monitor and the kerning are slightly different.**

**I’d been writing up plans and specs on WORDPERFECT ever since Konami started using Macs, already 4 years ago. Ever since Ichitaro it’s always taken me a long time to get used to new software. I wrote everything for Metal Gear on WORDPERFECT. It’s like WORDPERFECT’s distinctive text rows, font size, and layout set a tempo without me realizing it. Well positioning the letters and figures helped me set a rhythm while writing plans. Not that Command or Windows are hard to use, but they feel different.**

**Metal Gear was ultimately something that I originally made in WORDPERFECT and Fukushima converted into MS-WORD.**

**After writing a few pages, things were feeling off, so I decided to call it quits for the day.** I ordered Ku-chan (possibly Kumi Sato) to make the logo for MGS2. I requested to keep it simple without reusing the previous logo. And of course, the same will be true for MGS3.

I called Ueno from the video editing room to set up a board evaluating the PS2’s graphics. He came in with Ku-chan beside him. I’ll have Kume-chan (possibly Takaaki Kumemura) do the settings tomorrow. I wonder if we’ll be able to see a demo tomorrow.

98/11/13 (Friday)

Kume-chan set up the board for evaluating the PS2’s graphics. He had a video up in about 5 minutes. The sample video was just a single 8 polygon square. It was even simpler than expected. Takabe will probably do something about it over the weekend.

I wasn’t able to do any writing on the plans today because of discussions and such.

\-98/11/16 (Monday)

Went to the hospital for the first time in a month. After waiting 30 minutes, I met with the doctor.

He seemed really happy when I told him I’d healed.

I felt nostalgic as I walked the winding road to the station I’ve gone down so many times this last half year. As I passed through the ticket gate, I hoped I’d stay healthy so that I’d never need to come back again. Goodbye to my days fighting illness….

Takabe showed the results of the last weekend at the Secret Lab. It appears he stayed at the company the whole time working. **500 Snakes were running around in the Metal Gear hangar. This was truly the impact I was going for\!** This guy’s awesome\! MGS2 really will be unique. A zone of things no one has ever seen or experienced. The staff all looked convinced that this would work. I think we could have about 200 using a mid-amount of polygons. I thought of adding in a scene when introducing the aircraft hangar where around 200 soldiers are all lined up listening to the commander’s speech. Just seeing that many from the start would add a sense of tension to the stealth.

I jokingly added a “no entry” mark and P4 display to the Secret Lab. I’m enjoying every morning more.

**Dewa-kun (Possibly Shoji Dewa) returned from Dallas. He brought samples of MGS trading cards. They look good. Thank you for making them so satisfactory, Dewa-kun.**

**Airstrikes on Iraq appear to have been averted. Iraq’s problems with nuclear inspections are part of the backbone of MGS2. There are suspicions that Metal Gears are being developed in Iraq….. history always repeats itself.**

\-98/11/17 (Tuesday)

Went back to the planning drafts. I will write the usual sort of thing, but I’m not sure how helpful it will really be. But well, we won’t get anywhere without at least a written document that serves as a point of reference for a unified purpose.

Today’s menu at Takabe’s secret lab: First thing in the morning I saw a screen of antialiasing and perspective, 300 Snakes wrapped in fog. It was quite good. Then I saw fog on the floor and blur. And finally split screen. The floor fog seems usable. It will be a way to obscure the terrain of the ground.

\-98/11/18 (Wednesday)

Spent the day, morning and afternoon, gathering information. Didn’t make much progress on the planning draft. Wrote the part about the setting.

After a while I had Muraoka look over 10 pages of it.

Today’s menu at Takabe’s secret lab: Light processing and back polygon edge folding.

Using 600 Snakes naturally made things freeze, so this time we moved around 450 Snakes. It happened to freeze on the first try this evening. Looks like freezing still happens on the PS2. These are just images though. 

450 people wriggled around the Metal Gear hangar. It was like the Honolulu marathon.

Displaying this many makes things look full. I asked staff how many people they thought it was and they said 1000\. That made me happy.

The first set of motion data we recorded at IMAGICA last month arrived. You can see Mei Ling’s dojou sukui on it.

**When I got home, ETV was broadcasting a special on child soldiers. Contents were mostly the same as this morning’s newspaper. Good timing. I thought I could use it for Raiden’s true past (background).**

**The American phonebook I ordered from KOA arrived. I immediately looked for Sarah Connor, amusing myself pretending it was the one from Terminator. I’ll use this for character names.**

\-98/11/19 (Thursday)

The planning draft is mostly finished. I’ll drop it onto the development server once I finish it tomorrow.

I moved onto the character backgrounds while getting opinions from staff.

Today’s menu at Takabe’s secret lab: Moving light sources and environment mapping. Multiple moving light sources looks like disco. The environment mapping is the same as what Takabe made before on the PS. It’s pseudo-environment mapping.

Nothing real surprising today.

Johnny (Johnny Sasaki) finished work on Mei Ling and started working on Snake’s model for MGS2. Shinkawa’s textures overseen by Mizupin (Takashi Mizutani) are inevitably beyond what can be done by designers alone, so we made Shinkawa’s characters look real. We gave up on making them look close to people that actually exist.

I regret not seeing the meteor shower the other day. It’s not an issue of it being a once in 30 years event or the last chance to see it, but that I’m surprised at myself for having lost interest in such things and finding them bothersome. Shouldn’t I have taken the initiative and shown my son the meteor shower? Back when I was a student, I definitely would have been watching the sky until morning. The Apollo moon landing or Soyuz docking and shuttle launch… I was much more curious and enthusiastic back then. I guess I’ve gotten old.

\-98/11/20 (Friday)

I autographed some MGS trading card mystery cards. Due to some issues with the printing process, I didn’t receive the full 100 that were planned, and just wrote on the 50 that did come. They have a special coating so an ordinary magic marker doesn’t write well on them, so Dewa ran off to get something from Mitsukoshi.

I signed them with Shin-chan (possibly Yoji Shinkawa) half at a time. My pen glided smoothly across the paper. I pushed down hard with the pen. There was a lot of range in the results. My signature took up a lot of space, with the letters smudged and the card design put to waste. Like where it says 1998, you can’t even tell what the 9 and 8 are. “Whoever receives this might be mad”, I thought as I kept signing cards. But these trading cards…..came out well. Dewa also looked happy to have another job completed.

I finished writing the planning draft and put it on the shared server. Now the main MGS2 members can see it. I used a Mac with Mac specific fonts, so it doesn’t display neatly in HTML.

Today’s menu at Takabe’s secret lab: bending pin lights. The thing we made for PS and then ditched in the end. 6-7 lights squirmed around on screen, bending as they hit walls and obstacles. Looks like it will be doable this time\! However, if a light hits a thin wall such as a folding screen, it pierces through it, so we need to consider where we use this. Takabe had other work for half the day, so there was only one thing on today’s menu. He’ll also be at work tomorrow and the day after. Looking at him, I feel jealous of the technicians. The PS2 seems really fun.

I swam at the sports club. I swam 12 laps today, a mere 700 meters. It wasn’t so busy on Friday, but the pool lanes were crowded. Unsurprisingly, Christmas songs playing in the sauna and inside the club.

The evening issue of the Asahi Shimbun included comments from me in an ad for “Dark City”.

“There’s no mistaking it will go down in science fiction movie history”- Mr. Hideo Kojima, Metal Gear Solid director, game designer

I thought it was funny that they called me “Mr.” But it makes me feel kind of happy that I did something for a movie.

\-98/11/22 (Sunday)

I bought the Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time and an N64 console at the department store. I’d thought about buying it so many times since it released 2 years ago, but there ultimately weren’t any games I wanted to play, so I never bought it.

**I found Zelda and an N64 at the store. I went to the counter with my son, and tried to pretend that it was the kid that wanted it.**

We got back home and plugged in Zelda. I played the Kokiri tribe tutorial for a bit, but the 3D was harsh and made me feel bad. I guess it’s no good for me since I don’t do well with 3D……

**This is what I bought the console for. I have to get through it no matter what.**

I watched a nighttime special on NHK, “The Sea, an Unknown World”. I found some ideas for MGS2. In post WW1 Germany, a scientist tried to make money off of sea water. They’re currently doing research on how to produce lithium from sea water.

Could materials for nuclear weapons like plutonium be extracted from sea water or a nodule of manganese on the seafloor? It doesn’t really sound believable.

\-98/11/24 (Tuesday)

More Christmas decorations are going up around town day by day. Even in my own home, I noticed the usual Christmas decorations in the living room and entryway. Unusually, I’ll be off from work this year, so I should be able to take it easy and enjoy this Christmas.

I revised the planning draft and reuploaded it onto the shared server. Updating it puts at the top of recent files, so everyone will see it tomorrow. When I asked staff for their opinions on the draft, it appears none of them knew it was online and readable. I told them how to access the data, and then Johnny and the others started reading it. I should get some feedback at tomorrow’s daily report.

Today’s menu at Takabe’s secret lab: the influence of pin spots on shadows. They change and stretch when lights move like real shadows. They curve around barrels and bend off of walls. This processing is like something out of a dream. And many shadows appear when there are multiple light sources….

It displays alright. Nothing real surprising here. I feel like there’s something missing, but I worry if I request this or that it will cheapen the visual impact. Investing too much into lights and shadows won’t leave room for many soldiers. Focusing cinematically on a single point with simple polygons may be the way to go…. I’m still undecided on what direction to take things.

However, there’s no one to create the experience (immersion) I want by going after cinematic CG. It all comes down to the contents. That’s the route we need to take.

**I found a nonfiction book called Blood and Water: Sabotaging Hitler’s Bomb. Skimming through it, the codename “mikkel” caught my eye. I don’t know in what language, but apparently it means “fox”. It must have been the code name for some spy working on Nazi related operations. I want the codenames (protagonist and Dead Cell) to be weapon names this time (Raiden, Fatman, etc.). I want to give the nuance that they’re not being treated like people, but strategic pawns.**

\-98/11/25 (Thursday)

I haven’t turned on the N64 once since the day I bought Zelda. Zelda is really trending in parts of the company. Johnny is always loud about games, and Nakamura and the others have been raving about it. It appears Nishimura, Uehara, etc. are glued to it every day until morning. I’m kind of jealous. With how rough 3D is on me, giving it another go will be a pain.

The thing everyone talks about is the game’s difficulty. From the start (the first boss), it’s high intensity action. Muraoka got stuck on the first boss. I heard Okamura talk about how to beat it at lunch time. The game’s puzzles seem unsolvable without a strategy guide. Yet everyone who plays Zelda say that “that’s what makes you so happy when you do solve them\!” “It’s a game that’s got something to it, with so many underwhelming games lately, it’s the first game in while that feels like a game. It’s because it’s difficult that getting through it makes you really feel like you’re playing a game. Recent games play you instead of you playing them, but this is a real game….” That’s what everyone says. I guess that is what makes for a fun action game. Adjusting the difficulty of MGS was a problem I stressed over until the end. Why did it worry me? Because this is obviously a different era from when Metal released on MSX. Prices, global circumstances, players, and values have changed. That’s why I worried so much.

When asking a lot of people about the ideas on MGS, there’s quite a lot of overlap. It looks like the way to go is diving deeper into 3D polygon action.

**I worked on the background for Raiden and the protagonist. I put most of the first draft on the server. I also wrote up an item box heading and uploaded it.**

Today’s menu at Takabe’s secret lab: Multiple bodies of water. The surface is handled through environmental mapping, coming out with rather old looking CG quality. Maybe it’s impressive that it even renders on the actual machine.

98/11/26 (Thursday)

Had an interview with a French magazine. The writer was skilled at Japanese, so I didn’t need Scott’s help. Unusually, he took memos instead of taping, but it seemed like he wasn’t quite getting the slight nuances. He was happy that I said I liked French movies and Enki Bilal. So I guess there’s that.

With help from the sound team, I had him listen to the French voice acting. It was Wolf’s death scene. He was very happy with what a realistic performance it was. For some reason, after he listened to it, he kept saying “congratulations” over and over. He had found out from some article that I like wine, and so went to the trouble of bringing some wine (rose) all the way from France. I’m grateful. 

I added in more on the Arsenal Gear’s background, Solidus’ goals, etc. I bought a pearl blue and pearl purple pen. I had a lot of interruptions today and didn’t make progress on the plans.

As for Takabe’s secret lab, with things go poorly with the German translation, we took a break today.

I miss him…

\-98/11/27 (Friday)

It’s DC’s release date.

I worked on Solidus’ character background. I definitely don’t want to make Solidus evil, so I’ll include a group of old guys called the Patriots who are gnawing away at national security in the shadows.

I realized today that I was mistaken on the meaning of “Solidus”. Checking with Okaji (possibly Noriaki Okamura), apparently it means a state that is neither ice nor water. I changed the image lines. A curve showing the melting point and composition of the solid phase, is apparently called a solidus line.

Just before going home, I took a look at DC’s Godzilla. I just thought it seemed interesting. The backgrounds, textures and camerawork weren’t the best, but it would have been good if they made it properly. Ifukube’s music was cool. 

The third stage was in Umeda, Osaka. I saw the nostalgic buildings of Umeda like the Hankyu, Hanshin, and Dai 4 buildings be destroyed by Godzilla. I wanted Shin-chan (Yoji Shinkawa?) to destroy KCE Osaka, but he couldn’t find the building. At least he destroyed Osaka Konami.

\-98/12/1 (Tuesday)

I read an article about 25th Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Boorda, promoter of the arsenal ship concept, in “Military Review.” It seems he was a true example of the American dream among the Navy's elite officers, having risen from the ranks as a sailor. The idea of an arsenal ship was a concept only he could have thought of. If arsenal ships caught on, the Navy would lose its role. It was seen as an improper way of thinking against the spirit of the Navy as well. It seems he received a lot of attacks from elite officers among the aviators and submariners. In MGS2, I’ll set it that the marines take over the plan for the arsenal ship.

I began preparations for tomorrow’s PS2 debriefing session. I arranged the desks in the seminar room, and set things up. I asked Ku-chan (possibly Kumi Sato) to make a sign advising where the bathrooms and vending machines are. It’s really like something you’d pay tuition for.

In total, it seems there will be about 20 people at tomorrow’s session. Good work everyone.

It took most of a day to put the VTR for the explanation onto 8mm. I separate one processing video by one minute, with a loop video in between. Takabe is supposed to help with the explanations.

Held a rehearsal at the seminar room in the evening. The screen was dark, so we did it with the lights off. The big screen made things impactful, but since it’s working through video, you can’t really tell anything about the anti-aliasing.

I used Okaji (Okamura?) as a test to see what an ordinary person’s reaction would be. He was naturally impressed at seeing 450 Snakes all at once. I’m still undecided on showing it to the MGS2 staff tomorrow. If it is tomorrow, I’ll also need to show it to other KCE.

**I want to ask Kyle Cooper to do the intro for MGS2. Eraser, Mission Impossible, and Twister were all him…. all Kyle’s style. I’ve gotten more appreciation for his talent. I want to get him to do it no matter what it takes.**

**Kyle was born in August 1963, the same month and year as me. We’re the same sign, the same fate.** The email, phone number, and address of Imaginary Forces, a company Kyle created, were in the materials I got from Ku-chan. I’ll reach out around New Year’s.

I want to attempt the first real time title screen in the industry, but if that’s impossible then I’m fine with a video\! I’m already picturing Kyle style intros in my head. What I really want to try is real time opening credits. I don’t know if it’s possible, but I have ideas.

98/12/2 (Wednesday)

The main MGS2 staff members gathered in the seminar room at 10:30 and we held the preparations for the PS2 briefing session. This was the first time the PS2 was unveiled to the members. Takabe’s explanation and the cutscenes recorded on video finished in 15 minutes. When I asked people for their thoughts, they weren’t all that shocked. Just that they saw the number of polygons was a lot higher than the previous PS and DC. It must be that they had high expectations, and having not seen much of the PS2, I overestimated things in my head. According to Uehara, it’s a great piece of hardware. Toyopi (So Toyota) was happy with it. Yeah, looking forward is the way to go.

We held the PS2 debriefing session at 2:00. We were patching things up right until start time to have a video of 5 metal gears and 5 Snakes ready. When the metal gears extend their legs, you get a real sense of their size. I felt like things looked pretty good.

As expected, it was all people I didn’t know in attendance. The session started 5 minutes late.

Uehara gave a relaxed explanation of the PS2 specs. No matter how many times I hear it I still don’t quite understand it. The response from the attendees was rather quiet for some reason. If this was a class at school, they’d definitely have been sleeping. It felt like they had shown up to the wrong place. Maybe they’re not suited for this industry.

We then entered an explanation using video before the explanation on GS (graphic synthesizers). The lights were turned off, and the video began. The SCE logo and PS mark appeared…. “Damn, they’re not going for it\!\!” No one smiled. It obviously failed to pull them in….

The sight of 450 Snakes got a few gasps from the viewers, but it wasn’t as much of a reaction as I thought it would be. After the video finished, we had people break into groups of 6 to enter the secret lab and see videos on the actual machine.

Having them view the actual machine individually turned out to be ineffective, so we made a change of plans and entered a Q\&A.

Uehara politely answered questions. I had no idea what he was talking about. He smiled as he talked about substitution expressions and number directives, but I have no idea what about it was interesting.

I got an email from Scott that MGS had been chosen by the official PlayStation magazine for “game of the year.” “Huh? What about Zelda?”, I thought, before remembering that it was the PlayStation magazine.

An American comic magazine that Shin-chan had bought included an ad for MGS action figures by McFarlane Toys. Apparently they release February next year.

Yoshiike (Hiroaki) borrowed the movie “Eyes Without a Face.” I had told him mostly jokingly to watch it because it’s scary, but it looks like he actually borrowed it. It’s a French movie that was intensely scary when I saw it as a kid.

98/12/4 (Friday)

Wrote some concept documents for Z.O.E. from morning. In the afternoon, I had a meeting with Okamura about what direction to take with it.

After finishing up with Z.O.E., I finally participated in a review meeting of Integral VR. It was already around 3:00. It progressed from sneaking to weapon to advanced to special. The weapon mode was interesting. Shooting at targets and enemies will be a fundamental part of the game. Seeing Nikita’s 1st person screen made me become nauseated with the 3D. I left out a few aspects of the special and called it quits for today. There aren’t any real problems with the stages, but we need to pay attention to camera positioning and other adjustments.

I swam at the sports club. Since it was Friday, it was empty.

\-98/12/6 (Sunday)

I went to the Akihabara transportation museum with my son.

We saw a model of the world’s largest tanker on the museum’s 3rd floor. I imagined it was the tanker level and tried to picture Snake moving around it. It would be extremely difficult to board the tanker from the water while it’s at sail. That’s something visible just looking at the model. He could hide in a container of some sort, but that wouldn’t really be Snake’s style. It might also be impossible for him to try stealth parachuting onto the deck during a storm.

\-98/12/7 (Monday)

Saw Velvet Goldmine with Muraoka at Cinema Rise. It was gross. I think young people will watch this movie and get the mistaken impression that Glam rock is gay music. And Ewan McGregor’s Iggy Pop was too fat.

\-98/12/8 (Tuesday)

Evaluated the remaining VR stages (special) in the morning. The staff poorly reviewed the Yamashita stage, but it’s a well-considered one. The issue isn’t the puzzle solving, but that the answer is ambiguous and unclear. I want to add stages with puzzles that test intellect over technique. I wrote up some specs for the VR disc.

Mineshi made the backgrounds for the ninja stage. The Z.O.E. evaluation is tomorrow, so we mostly focused on that. As a result, I didn’t get anything done on the MGS2 plans today.

A model of Mei Ling displays in the survivor photography mode. She didn’t look very lifelike, so I had someone do environmental mapping on her eye balls. Not that my expectations were all that high….

This is good\!\! Although they look a bit like doll eyes. It’s like a ray of hope has dawned for her. This decoration looks pretty good. She doesn’t look all that human, but like some other kind of life. If we tweak the environmental mapping alpha blend a bit more, we might get some good eye moisture. And if I feel like it, I’ll have them make the bottom lip as a separate model and have it environmentally mapped. If that succeeds, her lips will be as gleaming and lustrous as something out of a makeup commercial. I plan to have teeth environmentally mapped in MGS2. The life of a doll comes from it’s eyes and mouth.

We entered in Okaji’s (Okamura?) eyeball programming, and Mei Ling’s eyes moved strangely. Next we’ll need data to direct her gaze alongside motion data. Having it linked with her motion to an extent and directing the rest when making cutscenes might be good. Making those cutscenes will probably be a pain though.

I want enemy soldiers to act when they see Snake’s weapons and equipment. I’m also thinking of events where they proceed based on where their partners are looking.

I wondered about what makes things look natural. Of course with skin and clothes, their materials and colors are different, so they reflect differently than in the real world. The reflectance ratio is different. Furthermore, black things absorb light. Essentially, in nature, things look different depending on their color and material. That’s not what happens with current CG. No matter how much you put into textures, skin, clothes, and buttons all reflect the same. That’s why they all look like paper model kits. You can turn the shooting on or off for individual pieces, but really it’s not a matter of on/off, but slight variations in reflectance ratio that you want. Even if I say that to programmers, no one has a good response.

There was one other topic today: displaying wrinkles. Either simulating them physically or creating a texture with wrinkles on it and morphing it. Toray Industries is developing a fabric simulator for use in designing clothing that can calculate how fabric will wrinkle and flow. But of course, it’s not in real time.

It appears Synergy Interactive went bankrupt. There was an article about it in a newspaper column. I was a bit shocked. Synergy was a leader in multimedia back in the days of PC-98 and 3DO.

I swam at the sports club. “Massachusetts” by the Bee Gees was playing.

\-98/12/9 (Wednesday)

I wrote the VR specification documents. Also made an opening polygon cutscene using models and animations from photography mode.

I used the PS2 photography mode Mei Ling. She’s high resolution and pretty. Her bangs look like real hair. However, nothing surprising. If the textures are too straight, it will be tough to add in details. There’s no bump mapping feature on the hardware, so details need to be made with polygons, and using light to create shadows may be effective. I may need to employ a lighting specialist. The PS2 is all about the modelling. There’s no taking shortcuts with the textures.

\-98/12/10 (Thursday)

Mouri (Meijin Mouri) came to the company, and we confirmed his participation on MGS2. I’d like him to work on the story somehow, but since Metal is ultimately a “game”, we’ll prepare the story here. With MGS2 being a game, the story ties in with the gameplay. It’s not something we can leave to someone else. We’ll have Mouri as an advisor, same as with the last one. He’ll check major contents like the plot, backgrounds, and direct enemy soldier strategy. I also plan to use Mouri’s personal connections to help get some information.

It seems that since the release of MGS, Mouri has gotten a deluge of offers from the gaming industry, with the majority asking him to handle the stories.

I emphasized to Mouri again that this will be a long and shallow involvement. It’s an extremely hard thing to ask, but he seems happy to take it on. Once the outline of the game takes shape around March, we’ll negotiate, have him check things, and exchange opinions again.

The pocket station was delivered to the company just this morning.

Page 137:

I had just heard the news that the release date was changed from December 23rd to the end of January. Having it in hand, it’s extremely cute and cool. It’s a fantastic design. I hadn’t had much interest in it until now, but seeing it in person made me want one for the first time. Regardless of its features, just the design is enough to get me to buy one. It’s polished even on the inside, and feels high quality. It could work as a fashion item. It wouldn’t look weird if girls wore it around their necks.

Messing around with it, I was flooded with a well of ideas. That’s just what the pocket station does to you. Even just holding it and looking at it is fun. The general idea is that it uses infrared unlike previous game consoles, allowing for new possibilities. **I urgently wrote up some specs for a pocket station version of Integral. We went with Ring Project as initially planned. It’s programmed in Assembly, so I’ll have Okaji (Okamura) handle it. The pixel art will be done by graphic artist Nakamura.**

**I want to make a few of the events I thought of today using the pocket station like a stamp rally or Shibuya event a reality.**

Won an excellence award in digital art/interactive media at the 2nd Media Arts Festival held by the Agency for Cultural Affairs. 

Received an unofficial announcement of the award from CS operations department. At first, I mistakenly thought it was the grand prize, but checking the email carefully, it was just an excellence award. The grand prize is probably going to Zelda.

Got Mei-Ling to properly show up on PS2. She displays properly, but there’s nothing to say. It’s just incredibly normal. It looks like a computer game. It will be tough to do polygon cutscenes at that quality. I’ll have to think of something.

\-98/12/11 (Friday)

Began advanced processing for programming on Mei-Ling’s blinking, eye balls, and environmental mapping. The polygons were too striking on her jaw line. I had them add some blurring effects. It looked so-so. With too much blur, the screen starts to look like it’s in soft focus. The neck polygons also stood out, so I had them put bones in her neck and see if the polygons split when the neck twisted at impossible angles. At any rate, we’ll see how it goes with the tests and decide from there.

Shin-chan (Shinkawa) will start designing the mecha for Z.O.E. this month. I’ll also have Mizupin (Mizutani) and Johnny (Sasaki) make their own models of Snake as they picture him.

Saw Snake Eyes at Buena Vista in Roppongi. It’s the most De Palma movie since Raising Cain. I just don’t get what was with the red stone embedded in the pillar at the end. I can’t help but be intrigued, but I don’t feel like watching it again.

There was an article about MGS in US Today. It was a rave review. It also ranked 2nd in a poll of “what game people want for Christmas” in the American market. 1st was Zelda.

Swam at the sports club. It was empty. Friday is the perfect time. A nostalgic song by Christopher Cross was playing.

**I saw the 4th episode of the NHK special “Money Revolution”. It seems they developed an artificial stock market using artificial AI traders at the Santa Fe lab near the Los Alamos lab. It was made by geniuses, John Holland and Brian Arthur. It simulates stocks virtually like an earthquake predictor. It’s called the Santa Fe artificial market. I’ll include it in MGS2 and have Solidus use it to predict the destruction of Wall Street. I’ll also add in an episode where Otacon uses this virtual simulation to get rich trading.**

\-98/12/14 (Monday)

Officially ordered the Z.O.E. mecha designs from Shin-chan (Shinkawa). Will use the mecha settings he wrote for a doujinshi back when he was a student. For now at least, I want to see the silhouettes, so I ordered stand ins from Kobayashi. They’re designs from over 6 years ago. I revised them. I believe the six-year time lag will work out for the best. It’s just like with fashion.

Added a face to the head portion of the protagonist’s mech. It really started to look like Devilman. Will save the face for last. Gave skulls to the enemy mechs. **The cockpits are located in the waist, so I named them “dick seats” and asked that they get erect when using special moves. I want it to be slang in this world to say “aim for the enemy’s dick\!”** And when robots stay out in space for a long time, space ship worms and Martian barnacles form on them as parasites. Every time the robots move, worms trickle down from the colony. It seems with me and Shin-chan involved, the game is taking a different direction. However, it’s definitely breathed some new life into it. I made some planning application documents for Z.O.E.

Got sent a box of MGS trading cards. There weren’t enough for the whole staff, so I did a raffle. Even so, there was only one pack of die cut, but I guess that rarity is what makes them valuable.

Fixed Mei-Ling’s neck. Also did environmental mapping on her bottom lip. It looks just as good as I thought it would.

\-98/12/17 (Thursday)

When I turned on the TV at 7 AM, I saw news that the UK and US were air striking Iraq. America’s response to the refusal of nuclear inspections was use of military force. These air strikes do not have international consensus. It appears the strikes went on for 6 hours. They showed footage of injured people receiving medical treatment in a crater created by the air strikes in Baghdad.

I was extremely shocked. I remember the ’91 Gulf War. I was at work when I saw the news that air strikes were commencing. It was the first story that morning, green video taken with night vision filming. I felt extremely sad and gloomy. Is war unavoidable? The same thing keeps happening. What is the UN even doing?

What will the scope of this war be? Will it draw out a long time? That concerns me. Clinton intends to thoroughly crush Hussein.

If the conflict expands, and turns into a protracted war, I’ll have to call off the plans for MGS2. It will bring up painful memories. I’ll need to change the plot of MGS2 if it causes even the slightest offence, since the contents are rather touchy.

Will put doubts of metal gear being developed in Iraq in the near future of the 21st century at the forefront. The UN request an inspection, but Iraq denies it, and when a team arrives to conduct a coercive inspection, they’re taken hostage by Iraq. The story begins with building tension between Iraq and America. Rather than being relevant, it’s just the facts as they are. If it happens in real life, then it loses its value as fiction and entertainment. If a meteorite actually fell down to Earth, then no one would go see Deep Impact or Armageddon. From an ethical perspective as well, it’s wrong to poke fun at current events in a video game. MGS is a story that doesn’t work if there isn’t peace in the world.

The naming of Operation Desert Fox also makes me think of MGS. There are rumors of stealth and infiltrating bunkers as well. I feel exceedingly unhappy and regretful.

Received a box of the real MGS trading cards. Will open a pack every day.

\-98/12/18 (Friday)

Second day of airstrikes on Iraq. The scale of the war is expanding.

It appears a South Korean ship sunk a small North Korean submersible. Just what was it doing in South Korean territory? Was it in the middle of a special mission?

The MGS team held a special lecture at KCE school. Uehara, Mizutani, Muraoka, and I participated. Everything was already set up at the venue when we arrived at the 8th floor of 25 Mori Building. There was seating for 100 people, cameras to broadcast to people elsewhere, and another 100 people that couldn’t fit in listening from outside. I began by introducing the staff and then showing a video of Mei-Ling’s facial animations to grab attention. There wasn’t much reaction. From there came Uehara, then Mizutani, then Muraoka, lecturing for 20 minutes each. Then we did 20 minutes of Q\&A. I think it went alright.

Got Sonic delivered from Naka from SEGA. Looks like they made it in time for release. Amazing, amazing.

Immediately started playing with everyone.

Swam at the sports club. With it being the end of the year, everyone is off doing end of year parties or other things over the weekend, so it was the emptiest it’s ever been. Had a lane (flip turn only) all to myself. The lanes next to me were empty too.

\-98/12/21 (Monday)

Caught a cold for the first time in half a year. My throat hurts. My head hurts. My body feels sluggish.

I thought about going to the hospital, but remembered my last checkup must have been in March. With it being over half a year ago, I’d need to show my insurance card, and I didn’t bring it today, so I just took some Pabron S.

I’m the type that tends to catch a cold as soon as winter hits, but I hadn’t caught a cold this last half year. Well, I had had other illnesses and stomach pain. Thinking about it, it must be the stress from MGS.

Had a discussion with Okamura on the plot of Z.O.E. Went drinking in Ebisu with Matsuno. While we have different perspectives, we shared the same stress over the conflicts and struggles of being both a developer and a producer.

We drank good alcohol. Before I realized it, I’d had 3 beers and 2 glasses of wine.

\-98/12/24 (Thursday)

It’s Christmas eve. We finished Christmas at my house yesterday, so didn’t really have anything going on today, but at work, just like every year, there was some bloodlust. Sure enough, someone scribbled in their daily report that, “around this time of year, I just wish everyone would die…” Judging by the clothing the women were wearing, it doesn’t look like they had a date planned today. They must not be suited to the entertainment industry of making other people enjoy themselves.

Wrote up the main things that needed testing for MGS2. I want to bridge the gap between the European version and Integral and make progress on testing. There’s no greater pleasure or excitement than when I’m thinking up systems. I want to start testing right away. When thinking how good the DOOM 1st person POV was in Integral, I thought that perhaps 1st person attacks could be a main point of MGS2.

Merry Christmas…

\-99/1/7 (Thursday)

My first diary in 2 weeks. I was busy from year end through the start of the new year, so didn’t really have time to write when I got home at night. That’s the terrifying part about habits, how you skip them once then find yourself neglecting them the next day too. Before I knew it, I’d gone 2 weeks without writing. That’s dangerous, that’s dangerous. At this rate I’ll end up quitting the diary all together…

Went back to the MGS2 plans for the first time in a few months. It had been so long I’d forgotten the plot. That’s bad.

Worked on working in the boss battles and the character settings. Recently I’d been worrying that I might be getting too old, but ideas and visuals came to me one after another. Especially with the boss battle (rough) ideas, I couldn’t stop writing. My vision is expanding. It’s so fun. I’m impressed with myself. For the first time in a while, I felt charmed by my own talent. Looks like I’ve still got it.

However, there are so many characters, and the plot twist was too complex, so I need to revise and simplify things again. I think that games don’t need complicated stories, but looking at the expectations of players of the last game, it seems that the story was part of MGS’s appeal. I myself struggle to understand it. But when I read opinions on how “the plot twist was good” and “I want my expectations to be even more subverted next time”, it encouraged me that those sorts of elements would be necessary.

I might cancel the boss character “Old Man”. I’ll make a list tomorrow and strike a balance with the previous game.

On the way home, I felt that I really want to add in a female ninja. There are at least 3 characters from the last game that players will project the female ninja to be, Meryl, Naomi, and Wolf. No matter which ninja appears, the story could work, but none of them feel right. It would be too big a departure from the main story. At first I thought of having Ocelot with a reinforced build appear, but visually, a female ninja with pronounced breasts is better.

My conclusion today is of those 3, I’ll look into it being none of them. Maybe I’ll have a ninja appear and help Raiden as part of S3. That will bring her close to an environment Snake has experienced. I’ll use all 3 voice actresses, changing them from scene to scene using digital tricks.

**Saw the Magic Polynesian Show in Honolulu. It combined ancient fire walking with magic. It’s like a modern take on Polynesian Show.**

**It’s what you’d expect from the land of entertainment, America. As soon as I saw that magic, I knew I had to add in a genderless magician boss character. They bring out an empty box, cover it in cloth, and then when they take it away again, amazingly, enemies come bustling out from inside.**

**I pitched the idea to a few staff, but they didn’t really go for it.**

Bought a copy of “Yuriika” for the first time in years. It was mainly a special feature on Paul Auster. The contents were pretty in depth. I’ll need to read “The Locked Room” soon. **Made Raiden’s real name Fanshawe. I also want to use the name Quinn, the main character of “City of Glass”, somewhere as well.**

Mizupin showed me his latest human models. The shoulder composition, waist composition, and toes have really improved. Now we just need to figure out what to do with the hair.

The flu is spreading around the office quite severely. Shin-chan hasn’t been to work since New Year’s. I was feeling bad too, so I bought some liquid cold medicine at the pharmacy and took it. I went home early.

\-99/1/11 (Monday)

Today I wrote a contribution for Game Criticism, “Snake Eyes and De Palma”. It had already been a few weeks since I saw the movie, so I didn’t remember what happened very well. Well, I saw it a 2nd time on a plane around the end of the year, so it wasn’t so bad. There’s nothing worse than when you forget what you were about to write. Ultimately, I haven’t been able to write any good contributions since the first one this year. Hardly a sign of good things to come. Maybe that fortune I pulled with my son yesterday for “double excellent luck for parent and child”, wasn’t all that credible after all. Could be a bad omen.

As for Old Man, who I’ve been thinking of scrapping, Hirano brought me reference materials for his setting this morning. The contents are quite dense, so I can’t really use them as is, but there were some interesting parts. Bringing along 2 girls when doing an attack (Valkyries) is probably impossible ethically. Maybe I bring back Old Man?

Shin chan came back to work for the first time this year. I’m counting on you Yoji Shinkawa, discipline your body a bit harder\!\!

Handed over the MGS2 drafts and character settings. Held off with the Z.O.E. stuff. Had all the rough drafts so far collected in a file. Had a meeting with Mizupin at the center on researching the designs for MGS2. At any rate, I want to decide on the direction before the CPU comes. I want to decide if we’re going with Shin-chan’s touch, BD’s touch, or Johnny’s touch. I don’t want it to be drawing textures in detail, but using the materials as is and making use of lighting. Also, I want to make the faces flat then use shading to add in depth. I’m aiming for something that’s an obvious departure from current CG rendering.

My cold came back. Bought some kakonaru at the pharmacy and took 2\. My face had a bad color to it, so the guy at the register gave me some powdered vitamin C. How thoughtful.

Bought a rail pass on the way home. It’s good for 3 months, so up until 4/10. Whenever I buy these passes, I always envision the expiration date and imagine what will be happening around then. Will development be done by then, will I still be at the company, will I still be alive? Things like that. Mineshi had a copy of Paul Auster’s latest book “The Music of Chance” on his desk.

When I asked what was up with that, he said, easygoing as ever, that he bought it because he like the illustration on the cover. When I asked if it was interesting, he said he hadn’t read it. So he just wanted the cover and bought it for decoration without reading it? Won’t Paul be upset?

I read the Yuriika January issue on Paul Auster, but since I have no knowledge of modern American literature, I didn’t understand most of it. I must be a hopeless moron.

\-99/1/12 (Tuesday)

Supplemented the MGS2 plans and Fortune’s setting and boss battle. Matsuhana began working on a summary of weapons and equipment (based on camp records).

It seems things are somehow going well with Shin-chan’s character settings. He worked on Fortune today. Seems I don’t need to worry.

**Had Kume chan buy Half Life, an EDGE nominee for game of the year, as reference for MGS2. It’s graphics, distinctive gameplay, and attention to detail were astonishing. I felt like “I’d been outdone by the Americans\!” More than anything else, it’s got atmosphere to it, exquisite real time animations, and you can really feel the creator’s soul in the game. The scene with the accident in the lab gave me goosebumps. Major Japanese games don’t have this kind of soul.** While not a strikingly innovative game, its attention to detail, animation, and gimmicks are more than enough to carry the gaming world. There are breakable objects, bullet holes left, and when you drop a crate or drum into the river it floats. **Even the cutscenes give a refined level of freedom, and if I were to make MGS cutscenes interactive, this is what I’d point to. But this technique won’t work for a game as story centric as MGS.**

Half Life also has a hazard course training mode. It’s a mode that originally started with Tomb Raider, but now it’s apparently become mostly standard on PC.

Page 138:

I had thought of not doing a VR mode in MGS2, but I’m not really sure.

Swam at the sports club. Because I caught a cold, I got out after 5 laps. Even still I was tired.

\-99/1/13 (Wednesday)

**Another industry first, another new system is born\! This one must be patented.**

**I’d been bothered up until now on how to overcome the non-interactive time with polygonal cutscenes. This was the biggest obstacle and problem in the fusion of game and story. In the case of MGS2, which has a complex story structure, "the real-time method of Half-Life' would not convey the plot to the player. So, today I came up with the idea of a split-screen polygon cutscene. At some point during the game, the screen will split, with one screen representing the traditional polygon cutscene and the other screen continuing the game as before. The split can be up and down or left and right as needed.** This method of separation can be used to explain all the simultaneous events and foreshadowing that the main character isn’t present to see, like “……meanwhile at X place….”. Especially in bomb demolition scenes where three people are involved at the same time, the sense of realism is sure to skyrocket with the use of this method. It is also flexible and can be used to show the story by displaying it on the screen. Maybe it was a good thing I went and saw “Snake Eyes.”

**Changed the background for the old soldier. There are already other hard to understand characters, so I’ll make him fairly straightforward. Cancel the ex-terrorist angle and make him a desk-bound guy who used to be a bomb disposal advisor for the N.PD. He wasn’t a terrorist, but made a mistake in dismantling a bomb more than a decade ago, and retired because of it. I’ll make this character Ed from Policenauts. Especially since I want to see Iizuka kin (Shozo Iizuka).**

For the first time in a while, got back to testing on P4. Today was character testing. The idea is to render a toon shading-like rendering on the actual console. The light source is painted in solid color below a certain value as a shadow. In reality, the model is actually drawn twice, so twice as many calculations are required. The goal is to achieve a texture similar to that of an animation cell, and ultimately, aim for something like BD or Shinkawa’s illustrations. The first try was with Mei-Ling, but things looked quite rough depending on the angle. However, we succeeded in making the legs and other parts of the body look very cellular. This is probably because the texture of the legs is quite flat. Smooth shading is applied to the lighted areas. Now we try layering more highlights. The highlight areas are painted solid white and alpha blended. Next, we put the shadows in at the 2nd stage and shifted the area slightly to show them off. It gave off kind of a blurred effect. I suppose we could have applied anti-aliasing, but it doesn’t look like it would work with this approach. It was just so-so, but it's only the first day. However, even that took three times as much processing as a normal polygon display.

What will happen if we add screen division, shadow processing, real-time shading, etc…..

\-99/1/18 (Monday)

Mizupin showed me his work on integrating polygon shadows into models. It looked pretty workable. It might work with the toon shading we did the other day too.

Environmentally mapped shadows appeared on Johnny's New Snake. Nothing surprising,, but it looks like it could be workable with some ingenuity. However, The image is by no means as impactful as it looks. The boundary of the shadows is also covered with anti-aliasing. We tried experimenting with a flat texture. Had problems with the shadows on connecting polygons. Will have them think about how to handle it.

Got approval on the French version of SCEE. Now it’s just the Italian version left. 770,000 copies just between the initial UK, German, and French releases. Add in the Italian and American release and we accomplish our goal of 3,000,000\! The Spanish version is just a bonus. I’m happy it’s getting recognition from players around the world.

Swam at the sports club. Felt like I had a cold, so got out after 5 laps.

**Another industry first. The name is also an industry first: the "real-time reveal" system. This system is an attempt to present the grand finale of MGS2 in real time, with all the reveal sequences taking place with the guns pointed at each other. In MGS2, which uses a tense situation familiar from Tarantino and Ringo Lam's films in which three or more characters all have their guns pointed at each other, no one able to move, the characters are in a state of flux. Essentially, things are revealed as they keep their guns pointed at each other, new characters join in, and people change who they’re pointing their guns at. A new character reveals that “Snake was actually an enemy…”, leading them to change who they’re aiming at. Then Snake says, “you’ve got the wrong guy. I (Snake) was made to look like the enemy. It’s all a ploy by Solidus…” leading everyone to change sides again. Things go back and forth between Solidus, Ocelot, Snake, Raiden, Fortune, and Sergey, with it shifting who each one is pointing their gun at (their number 1 enemy). I want to do that in real time. The player keeps the weapon button pressed (with their gun pointed) and watches the game unfold. Once the player holds the gun, he/she cannot release the button until the end of the game. During this time, the player can change where they point their gun or adjust the prospective angle of attack. Flashback scenes would be done in split-screen mode. I wonder how it will turn out.**

 

**Will use FOXDIE again to disintegrate the Artificial Intelligence (Patriots) within the Arsenal. Emma's PAL code will be cloaked by her heartbeat. Make it so the PAL can be input when her heart stops beating. Ocelot would use truth serum to get this information from Emma. This is why he intentionally lets Emma go.**

Production shipments of MGS: 756,000 units in Japan, 1.38 million in America, 770,000 in Europe (just UK, Germany, France). Still short of the 3 million mark.

**I dropped by a CD shop with Muraoka and bought the best of OMD. In fact, we had originally planned to use OMD's hit song "Enola Gay" as the ending song of the last game. I remember Muraoka stopped me, saying, "none of the kids these days know about such an obscure song.”**

This morning, I listened to the best of the Beegees for the first time in a while, and it almost brought tears to my eyes. Maybe it’s just my age getting the better of me. I think I’ll buy some Billy Joel next.

\-99/1/21 (Thursday)

Half-Life is well done. It has quite impressive depth to it, but it is the gimmicky details and the crazy American ideas that make it so appealing. In the scene I saw today, a bioweapon gun can be attached to one hand, and an insect-shaped (insect-shaped alien itself) bio-bomb can be used as a weapon. It is effective against enemies, but if you are not careful, it will harm the player. The animation of holding the bio-bomb is cool too. It is not so much I have fun with it as it is I have respect for the good sense of the game. There aren’t really Japanese games like this. It’s a good game. Especially as a Western game.

Somehow, even by current global standards, the volume of MGS2 needs to be greater than that of its predecessor. The current plan is quite rich in volume. This time, however, the deadline for the release date has been set from the beginning, even more so than with the new hardware. It is difficult to find a balance between volume and production time.

**Will make it possible to select the missions that must be completed mid-game and make them diverge. Snake and Raiden will run concurrently. I don't really want to do this, but there’s no denying that it is a trend in today's game market. Instead of a choice, the player decides which mission to go on in real time. The other will automatically be done by Snake.**

Changed the name of Old Man to Old Boy. The term "Old Boy" apparently means not only a cunning old man, but also devil.

Swam at the sports club. Finished really early today. “Point of Impact" is so interesting. I think I'm going to be hooked on Stephen Hunter for a while. On the way home, I bought a copy of "Dirty White Boys" at a bookstore in front of the station. 

\-99/1/25 (Monday)

It is now 1:30 at night. The last train had already departed, so I came home on a different line. I'm glad the rain has stopped. Still, all these drinking partings are taking their toll. My intestines are in bad shape.

Mizupin is having a hard time rendering Shin-chan's style. We'll have to wait and see how things go for a while longer. From how things went today, though, it doesn't look promising. I guess we'll have to go with orthodox CG. ...... But there’s no way that will succeed.

Bought Jack Finney's "From Time to Time". Ran into Nishimura at the bookstore. When I told him about the book, he immediately went to buy it. It’s easy to talk to people of the same generation. I thought I couldn't even finish reading "Back to the Beginning." I remembered how I couldn’t get through “Time and Again.”

**Added the setting for Old Boy and my vision of his boss fight. Old Boy's attack method changes depending on the weapon used by the player. Programming and balance will be difficult.** 

**The first draft of "The Truth about Shadow Moses" has been completed. Ah\! All that’s left is to add in the additional elements and foreshadowing. It will be about 300 pages of manuscript paper. The trick will be how to make people that don't like to read print nowadays to read it.**

Went to Ebisu for a New Year's party with Scott, Hattori, and the rest.

Members attending were President Yoshioka, Matsuhana, and Okamura. It was a restaurant serving delicious fish. The sashimi was delicious. Hattori drank a lot of sake and was very intoxicated. Then, as is tradition, we went out for karaoke. We listened to “Fantasy" by Earth, Wind & Fire, a real karaoke song. The karaoke was kind of boring.

The theme from "Titanic" at the end was good.

\-99/1/26 (Tuesday)

I was so tired today. I’ve had a severe stomachache since yesterday, but it reached its peak today. I felt bad today. On top of that, I had terrible diarrhea this morning. This is the second consecutive day it’s been like this. Even so, I get pure black stool after I’ve had red wine. I wonder if that has something to do with it.

Had Mizupin show me an experimental cutscene with Shin-chan's touch to it. There are still some uncertainties to it, but the potential is coming into view.

**Will make the arsenal gear into a giant turtle. The challenge is how to make it look big without being cartoonish. Changed the last part to stop the chase by boat and to make the turtle go out of control and head for Manhattan.**

\-99/1/27 (Wednesday)

Johnny began his second round of tests on CG modeling. Snake. He's putting teeth in Snake's mouth.

Got the second batch of Shin-chan's rough character drafts. Vampire is now a hairy man instead of a narcissistic one. What should we do? 

\-99/1/28 (Thursday)

Converted the rest of the character backgrounds to HTML. Updated all the WORD documents made so far to 6.0. I will finish all of the character settings by the end of tomorrow. Next month, I have to write a MGS proposal for GBC.

**Watched the ending of Half-Life. It was just like watching a movie. The ending is incredible.** The world, designs, animation, and coloring are so….unique. In particular, the animation of the spider "ball sack" (as I call it) is physiologically quite disgusting, similar to "Drifting Classroom". I wonder what kind of life the people that made this live.

The last boss was a giant fetus. I can't have this kind of character as a boss enemy anymore now that I have a child, but there’s no mistaking it made for great imagery. The size and the presentation were superb, and the fact that it was presented not in a cutscene but in real time was also amazing. The last part was also unique. I would like to meet the developer who created this game.

Skipped the sports club today. I have a cold, so I will take precautions.

\-99/1/29 (Friday)

Went to take a peek at a conference hosted by SGI at Yebisu The Garden Hall. Enter the lobby. Ton of people. Probably because it was free admission?

Well, it was interesting to hear the president of Polygon Pictures talk.

“You can't do the same thing as other people. If you compete on quality, you won't stand out.” It’s an obvious statement, but it applies to the current direction of MGS2.

\-99/2/1 (Monday)

The Mac I have at home won’t turn on. I can’t reset it either. It’s dead. The SadMac icon appeared. It’s my first time seeing it. Trying to hard kill it causes a warning sound I’ve never heard before.

Nothing to be done, I’ll bring it to work…..

Bought an illustrated screenplay of Titanic. Cameron really is amazing. As usual, the BTS and his commentary are more interesting than the movie itself. **Since the main character’s name is coincidentally also Jack, I’ll name his girlfriend Rose.**

**Secondly, I’ll make Snake’s alias be Plissken. It’s probably best to joke around here.**

Changed Colonel Gurlukovich to a female character. Don’t you need another love interest besides the girlfriend?

Which is why I’ve decided to add in the Colonel’s daughter. She’s a spy for the Patriots, so she’s an ally of Raiden. I’ll make a situation where no matter what, she and Raiden have to fight in front of Solidus. Asked Scott about what her name should be, and went with Olga Gurlukovich. **The name Olga came from an actual staff member at KOE.**

**Changed the girlfriend’s role. Instead of giving support over radio, I’ll have her be a hostage. Raiden will try to save her, but it will be a gothic romance where they cross paths at every turn.**

Bought an English slang dictionary and looked for a code name for Dead Cell. Will use a different expression than “taboo” in the American version.

\-99/2/2 (Tuesday)

The SadMac (crying face) message appeared on my home Mac, so I gave up and brought it to the office, although it was heavy. I asked Kume-chan to take a look at it first thing in the morning, and to my surprise, it was working. He said it must have been fixed by some kind of shock on the way to work. When I said that was ridiculous, he answered with a laugh, "That's just how Macs are.” Well, it's heavy, but I have to carry it home again. Since I brought it, I’ll have them upgrade to the new version of MS-WORD.

I wrote a draft for Metal Gear GBC. Although it’s a draft, it's a thin one just outlining the concept. I couldn't come up with many ideas. I only added supplemental features here and there, but nothing that would be a core component.

I spent the evening completing the Tatebayashi version of "Drama Series Vol. 3: Tabidachi no Uta. The marathon and the collection of letters are not the most exciting of events, but it was quite good. This character does not have the same charm as the other characters. This may be the first female Tokimemo character that I can tolerate. I think people who like her will cry. I guess it wasn't as bad as I had feared. Since I have MGS2 coming up, I don't have time to work on the production as I did with "Nijiiro".

I bought a history book on New York. For some reason, New York seems to be having a surge in popularity right now, and there are a ton of tourists. Of course, it seems to be popular among Japanese as well.

**Decided on a pseudonym for Snake. I chose “Iroquois” which means poisonous snake in Algonquin, the language of the natives who originally lived in Manhattan.**

MGS2 will be a serious portrayal of "America," incorporating the history of New York, which is also the history of the U.S. I will do some studying before going to New York for fact finding.

Scott brought us the European product version of MGS. The packaging, instruction manual, etc. are in good taste. It looks pretty good\! Europe\! Currently, 870,000 copies have been ordered.

Finally saw the ending of Hybrid Heaven. It was so popular that by the end the staff were crowded in like a gallery. This game must have some kind of allure to it. There is no doubt about it. You couldn’t save in the leadup to bosses, so Uehara seemed to have a lot of trouble with the game. The end of the game was like a Hollywood movie. The President had good taste.

Tomorrow is expected to be a heavy snow day.

\-99/2/8 (Monday)

It's been a while since I've written in this diary, due to drinking parties and a business trip to Kobe. I stop writing when I've really been slacking off for a while.

Mizupin showed me his facial animation tool for MGS2. It is easy to do eye blinking, lip synching, and skin stretching, etc.

Went to KCET to look at PS2 CPUs. They were hidden under the desk in a huge white box.

Uehara read through the thick manuals (4 or 5 volumes) as if they were interesting. When I asked him if they were interesting, he replied that "yes, they are” and continued to read, entirely absorbed in them. I really don't understand engineers.

I got 1 more PS2 graphics board from CS and took it home. The cab ride home was not as tense as the previous one. It was easy going. Now I have three graphics boards. I used to call them by the code names, "Naoto Kirihara" and "Naoya", but now that I have three boards, I'll call them "Ran”, "Su", and "Miki”.

\-99/2/9 (Tuesday)

Wrote specifications for Snake Support. A plot that branches off in the middle is a good thing, but if it becomes obvious that it’s only there because the creator wants you to play twice, then it’s all over. Must be careful not to overdo it.

It turned out that Johnny had been working on an animated cell-like texture models on the actual console while I was on that business trip. When I went to ask him what he thought of them, he said they were no good. The models would have to be redesigned with more polygons to make them look good. Things aren’t looking promising, It doesn’t feel like this will succeed. We may have to remove it from the list of options. Will try again with a new vamp model.

I am not sure if anyone has tried real-time toon shading yet, but I am confident that it will be a common process in the near future. I am personally convinced that this process will become commonplace in the future. Even if things continue progressing, at this rate, other companies may do the same thing before we release, and if that happens it’s all over. We still need a new visual approach that isn’t just some cheap trick. We need to stay a step ahead of everyone else.

Page 139:

Shin-chan is finishing up color images of Raiden. For some reason, they are starting to look like Amano’s style. Shin-chan's drawings have become much better than when he first started working here. However, looking closely, while he does have artistic skill, his pictures don’t give off the same vigor as the ones he did as a newcomer. What I am looking for from him is not a but his unique ideas and style. I remember when he drew a doodle of Captain Underpants.

Will be traveling to Europe from March 5th through to the 10th. Plan to go around London and Frankfurt. Currently, 950,000 units sold. U.S. sales are at 1,470,000.

**Dirty White Boys was interesting. Stephen Hunter is a great man. He makes me really want to add in a character to MGS2 who grew up in the South.** I'm going to start reading Black Light tomorrow. I've been going around bookstores looking for his past works, but I can't find them anywhere.

Was supposed to go to the pool today, but I wanted to go home early, so I skipped it. Got home before 7:00 to find my son awake. It is wonderful to see him every evening.

\-99/2/10 (Wednesday)

Wrote specifications regarding the enemy soldiers. I'm going to have a hit box for each body part (head, neck, chest, hands, legs, etc.) so that 1st person attacks can be used strategically. If it works, it will be another industry first.

**At Sonoyama's station, they got the experimental 1st person perspective to work. The current version lets you move around. This would be no different from Half-Life. I gave it a try, and found that it was incredibly difficult to hit the head or heart in 1st person. You have to get very close to get any accuracy. It feels close to the feeling of shooting for real.**

At Okaji's (Okamura?) station, I saw "Title Animals" written by Nakamura. It is hard to believe that it is written in 4 patterns. He was a pixel craftsman before he was a vibration craftsman.

\-99/2/11 (Thursday)

Today is National Foundation Day. I woke up this morning and had no idea what day it was, but my son told me. When I asked him how he knew, he showed me a Disney calendar. It said “National Foundation Day”. Pretty useful for a McDonalds toy.

The next three astronauts were chosen. I watched the news of the press conference at NASA. The one who’s going to be the second female astronaut is a beautiful and intelligent woman.

Whenever I see this kind of news, I always feel a sense of jealousy. It is probably because I want to go, but I can't. 

There are three things that make me jealous: Japanese people going to space, people that aren’t directors (actors, TV personalities, novelists) making movies, and actors publishing art books even though they aren’t good at it. Like when they hold solo exhibitions..…….

\-99/2/12 (Friday)

When I asked our staff members first thing in the morning, most of them said that they had bought "FFVIII" and had been playing it for about 10 hours. Many of them said they had gotten to the end of disc 1\. They were also playing during their lunch break.

Raiden's suit is now a skeletal suit, which was Shin-chan's idea. Since in the previous game it was a muscle suit, this is just right. We call it the skull suit. Shin-chan's ideas always help me out.

Didn’t get anything done on MGS2 today either. We had a schedule meeting at 11:00 a.m. and a CS meeting at CS (headquarters) in the afternoon. It’s already been a year since the last one. This time, KCE Osaka and KCE Kobe will be connected via video broadcast from the Phoenix Building in Osaka. This was my first ever official video conference. I had mocked the idea of a video conference a bit….. but it turned out pretty well. I didn't feel the distance between us. It is plenty sufficient for a report-oriented meeting like today's. If this were to be expanded to a 3-way broadcast, it might look like the aspirational science fiction films of the past.

\-99/2/15 (Monday)

Wrote specifications for player bleeding and 1st person attacks.  Had Sonoyama start testing on 1st person. Played it on the PS system. It’s pretty fun. However, the game loses its sense of speed. Running and stopping, aiming and shooting ...... would become the core of MGS2. It changes the visuals slightly. The problem is how to set the tempo. Also, how much of an advantage will 1st person mode be to the player? Or will it be a disadvantage?

I didn’t expect the FA-MAS tracers to be effective. It is difficult to see bullet trajectory in 3D, but using tracers made it incredibly easy to follow. There’s no mistaking this is how they’re used in real life too.

**I talked about making the ending and opening songs Billy Joel's "Glass New York” (You May Be Right) and Frank Sinatra’s “New York, New York” with Muraoka. The keyword is definitely “New York”.** I went to a CD store and bought the best of Billy Joel. I sang "Honesty" at karaoke the other day, so I suddenly wanted to listen to it.

Fusshi (Tomokazu Fukushima?) wrote a setting for the new FOXDIE. It's themed around prion. It looks pretty good. The book about prion, which I had been meaning to read, was on Fusshi's desk. In fact, prion appeared in a short-lived project that I planned in 1990 but never realized. At the time, I had no idea that prion would become such a major player.

MGS orders in Europe reached 1.02 million units. This brings the worldwide sales to 3.25 million units. That makes 3.4 million if we include the Spanish version. I wonder if it will go up to 3.5 million?

\-99/2/16 (Tuesday)

Wrote the specifications for the enemy soldiers. Summarized their three senses, types, behavior, alert mode, etc. If all the specifications we are trying to do this time are included, we should be able to create a "new experience" that will be a first in gaming history. If we can do this, we won't even need a storyline. We might even be able to get away with low polygons. It's been a while since I’ve felt so excited by my own project.

Tentative experiments on individual enemy soldier body parts are now being done at Korepi’s (Yuji Korekado’s) station. We have animations of the head, limbs, torso, and other parts of the body that were already implemented by Toyopi (So Toyota). When I actually played it, as expected, I didn’t hit the target. Will make it so the camera zooms in when extending your arm in 1st person.

Had Mineshi show me the MGS2 experimental backgrounds. They’re intentionally drawn with smooth shadows to match the illustration style. It is on an actual PS console, so it can only be seen on PS. There is no impact to it. The only way is to try to show the background and characters on the actual device after the presentation. You could say going the direction of animated renderings is mostly scrapped.

Bought the second volume of Black Light. I set up a gauge for enemy soldiers, a reference to Bob Lee Swagger's classification of causes of death by bullets. I also tried to reproduce the behavior of the enemy soldiers from an anatomical point of view.

Went to the club for the first time in a week. The flip turn lane was open. I swam slowly at my own pace. Crawl one way, breaststroke on the way back. I wish it was always this empty.

\-99/2/17 (Wednesday)

No morning meeting because of the AOU show, so I got up at about 6:40. I had planned to sleep in a bit, but ironically I woke up at 6:00. I looked to the side and saw that my son was also awake. I had no choice but to sing "Dango 3 Kyodai" in a whisper for about 30 minutes.

I was able to confirm that the settings I had made for enemy hits, blood loss, and mortality rates were not too far off from reality. Hirano brought me a copy of a back number of "Military Research”. It described the injury rates to various body parts of U.S. soldiers during the Vietnam War, and their resulting death rates. When I compared those figures with this project, I found them to be quite consistent. It could be used as a battlefield simulator.

The Italian version of SCEE was finally approved. Only the Spanish version remains. 750,000 copies in Japan, 1,470,000 in North America, and 1,040,000 in Europe.

Went to Makuhari for the AOU observation in the afternoon. It’s so far. Horribly far. Moreover, it is as hot as spring today. I took the "Donko" train from Hatchobori, so it must have taken 45 minutes. I finished reading the first volume of Black Light on the train. 

It was a good thing that Hatchobori station happened to have a power outage. The station was barely lit with lights at 30% or so on emergency power. It is rare to have such an experience. 

Konami was the top performer at the show again. There was a long line for both Guitar Freaks and DrumMania. What a relief, relief, relief….

Silent Scope also seemed to be well received

There were no other standouts. Naomi Board's Tecmo video for Dead or Alive 2 was well done.

Did a “Okaasan to Issho” photobooth at Purikura 21\. I chose a frame with big brother Kentaro in it. I took another two hours to get back to Ebisu.

I saw the new models for arms in 1st person at Sonoyama’s station. No textures have been applied yet. Actually looking at the arms, I think it is necessary to have them tremble when firing.

\-99/2/18 (Thursday)

Wrote specifications for the radio. Processing the radios in real time increases the sense of immersion, but it also puts stress on the system. If it is not handled properly, the radio may not become unusable. In order to give priority to the situation of the enemy soldiers (surroundings) during radio communication, will give up on having face displays of the person being communicated with.

**I asked around the staff about how if we are going to stop displaying faces on the radios, how about not showing Rosemary's face? We would ask players to just imagine Rosemary with only Kikuko Inoue's voice. They could imagine her as whatever type they prefer. The plan is to have a model of the player's ideal woman appear in the last cutscene. The player’s preferences would be asked throughout the game and then reflected in the end. However, the character won’t stand out if we do this. Also, if her visuals are not presented at the beginning of the game, there’s a risk that players will be less motivated.**

At Korepi's (Yuji Korekado) station, they were checking attacks on different body parts. When the enemy soldier's limbs are shot in 1st person POV, they are put into a "dharma" state. The enemy soldier cannot move, so it just thrashes around on the floor. I feel sorry for him, so I shoot him in the head to give him peace…….somehow it’s super fun. But also terrifying. Is it a completely different kind of gameplay (desire)?

\-99/2/22 (Monday)

I couldn't do any planning today. Tomorrow is the day I'll write the specs involving the camera.

From noon, We went to a private showing of Enemy of the State. It seemed that today was the last day to see the film, and there was a long line at Buena Vista. We arrived about an hour before the screening and found ourselves in the front row.

The plot was decent for a movie by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer. There was only one explosion. It was a very plain film. I liked it, but Shin-chan seemed dissatisfied. It is an interesting but difficult film to write about.

Went to a bookstore in Jimbocho on the way home. I looked for Stephen Hunter's old books, such as "The Day Before Midnight," "Tapestry of Spies," and "Second Saladin," but they weren’t available. I’ve looked in Kobe, Osaka, and Jimbocho, but still can’t find them. They must only be at used book stores

99/2/23 (Tuesday)

Wrote the specifications for the camera. Talked to the programmers about focus, pin, and other specifications, but I’m not sure if we can achieve them.

Had them make it zoom the camera only when pointing a gun in 1st person, but since you then can't see the hand anymore, we have to lie a lot. Make it so only during 1st person POV, have a different scaled arm attach to the camera. The workload will be tougher. We have to prepare the model, skeletal structure and animation separately.

Did voice recording for the giant monster Genola for the VR disc. I went to Muraoka's usual booth (in SD). My throat wasn’t feeling good today for some reason. So ultimately, Mccammon and I split the recording duties. Dodongo, Alien Baltan, Deabolica, Zetton, Dada, Finger Gelge, all made for inspiration. My throat hurt even more. I left the rest to McCammon.

Matsuhana and Shin-chan went to Shinjuku to buy materials. Plastic models of deep-sea exploration diving suits for deep-sea exploration, and a Harrier (alternatively a Sea Harrier) and a book about ships. They didn’t have the old Stephen Hunter books I had asked for. They asked the store to order the plastic model tanker for me. Imai is still making plastic models of tankers for overseas. Apparently they have a "tanker series". Hirano immediately peeked through the book about ships and made some strange noises.

Bought a new book by Jeffrey Archer.

Got an e-mail from Mori. (Mori Motosada)

He’s a US SOCOM anti-terrorism instructor, and a former Green Beret who was impressed by MGS. He wants to help with the next one.

**Matsuhana will start taking video for the weekend meeting, using a digicam recording of the pocket station to explain the FOXDIE project. Will need a hand model with nice fingertips.**

\-99/2/24 (Wednesday)

Went to a preview at Warner Brothers in Hamamatsucho. Met up with Hattori at the Hamamatsucho station ticket gate. She didn't show up when the time came. We were waiting for her at the exit near Warner Brothers. It was windy and awfully cold. In addition, it was raining.

Hattori was waiting at the ticket gate on the monorail side. I should have realized it earlier....... I might have caught a cold. I've been too slow in everything I do these days.

Had lunch at a restaurant in the station building. When I entered the restaurant, I saw only fathers. Businessmen right and left. Looking at the lunch menu, the steak set caught my eye. It comes with soup and salad for 800 yen\! So cheap\! It’s just like in Osaka. What's more, dessert is included for women\! Hamamatsucho is a great place.

It was raining hard, so we took a cab to Warner Brothers.

The Negotiator was pretty interesting. Kevin Spacey really elevated it. However, as with Enemy, it was difficult to write any commentary on. **The trailer of The Matrix that played at the beginning of the movie was really cool. It was an American comic book style hero story. Keanu is the main character. He was running sideways on the wall. He was like Chinaman from MGS2.**

On my way home, I went to a CD shop and reserved a CD of "Dango 3 Kyodai". Just as I was about to say the words "Dango ......" at the counter, I saw a flyer for a pre-order campaign in front of me. I pointed at it and asked if I could reserve one  The clerk prepared a reservation form for me. Good, they knew what I was talking about. I was afraid of being told "Dango?.....What’s that?”

\-99/3/1 (Monday)

PS2 CPU boards finally arrived at the company. Kume-chan and Takabe-chan went to pick up the hardware.

Immediately got things set up in the P4 room. I called up the character squad. Matsuhana steered the camera. The P4 room came alive for the first time in a while. It's looking good. The specula looks good if we use it well.

I read Sato's article in “Nikkei CG”. I see that he is a man of ability, guts, and energy. I am sure he will be fine wherever he goes. I am sure he will be fine wherever he goes. I used to think, "Young guys these days\!”, I thought, but there are young people like him out there.

Wrote a contribution for Game Criticism. Since I had already forgotten most of the contents of Enemy of the State and The Negotiator, I couldn't write anything good. Had to mostly fill it with things that weren’t thoughts on the movie.

\-99/3/2 (Tuesday)

In the morning, I prepare a schedule outline and staff list for MGS2. It is already far behind the original schedule.

Looked at some pictures of Syphon Filter, which is about to be released overseas. Looks like it might have 1st person shooting.

Just past noon, I headed to the Tokyo International Forum. I got off at Yurakucho and went straight to the hall.

There seemed to be some other events going on, but thanks to SCE's stylishly designed signage, I didn't get lost. As I entered the hall, I noticed a lot of foreigners and the press. I handed over my invitation letter at the counter and went inside. There really were a lot of foreigners. More than half of the people there were foreigners. They were all wearing translation earphones.

At 2:00 p.m., the "PlayStation Meeting 1999" began. A female announcer appeared as the hostess, and a 5-minute video rushing through the 5-year history of the PS was shown. The project looks back at the 50 million units sold, what titles were released, and events that took place over the five years. Three cuts of MGS were shown as part of 1998\. Unfortunately MGS was Konami’s only representation. After greetings by then SCE President Tokunaka, Kutaragi appeared on stage. He talked about the next generation PlayStation. His presentation was even better than usual. He was so energetic. After explaining the hardware specs and concept (Emotion Engine?), he explained some more while showing images. Mostly cutscenes that were shown at SCE headquarters in November. But Penguin Panic got me, it was more impactful than 500 Snakes. Uh oh. The idea of a "swarm" seems to be something everyone’s come up with.

After that, he passed the baton to Okamoto. He explained the development environment. Okamoto was very nervous and stiff. Then, Kutaragi appeared again. Today's main event. Tanaka, the technical director, appeared and introduced the experimental teams in order.

First up was SCE. Yamauchi from GT gave a presentation. He showed us GT, images rendered in advance by the CPU and played back on the actual console, much like what we’ve also been working on. Next was the game. A shiny car moved on top of the middle polygon background GT course. 

Next was From Software. Dozens of skeletons were wriggling against the backdrop of dark castle walls. Repeated animation. When the developer moved a fairy (phosphorescent particles) and it hit a skeleton, the skeleton crumbled.

Namco. The Tekken models were displayed as is, with polished backgrounds (city lights and steam) and about 30 onlookers.

Page 140:

Then they showed actual gameplay. It was quite close to completion.

Finally, Square. They had footage of the face of that one famous old man from FF. They demonstrated the facial animation and lighting movements. The model was 100,000 polygons\!

Last was FFVIII.  A dancing scene. It was limited to 2 characters. but it was very well done. The facial expressions, the hair on their heads, the swaying of their clothes, etc., were the most impressive part. The movie scenes up to this point are moving on the actual machine. Kutaragi got his point across when he said that, “these cutscenes are running on the actual console\!” 

The most impactful part of today's demonstration was the announcement that "PS2 is fully compatible with PS\!” The audience applauded and cheered.

On the way home, I got that copy of "Dango 3 Kyodai”. They already had a paper posted saying “sorry, sold out.” After returning home, I found out in the evening paper it had sold its first 100,000 copies.

It's been a whole three months since I last wrote in this diary. To think I skipped it for so long ...... even for me that’s surprising. The last entry was on March 2nd, and a lot has happened between then and today. Among the major events, I would like to mention a business trip to Europe, E3, fact finding in New York, and receiving the CESA award….

I want to try resuming this diary.

From about 8:30 in the morning, I connected to Sony's homepage. It was the AIBO pre-order day. I wanted one just because it's a "robot," and after talking to otaku king Muraoka the other day, I wanted one more and more. The AIBO looks like nothing more than a toy to my wife, but it is a robot that can walk on its own. I got her to agree that I could buy it as long as I didn’t bring it home.

After 9:00 a.m., a change was made to the website. However, my Mac froze, so I had no choice but to connect from Matsuhana's terminal and complete the reservation. The clock had already passed 9:20, but somehow, I made the reservation. What a relief.  I’ve already decided on a name. It's called "Ranman" (glorious). Later, I saw on the news that it sold out in about 20 minutes. I completed my reservation a bit after 20 minutes, so it was a close call.

Mori came at 11:00. I asked him to give lectures on clearing, soldier behavior, and movement over the next two days. As usual, we made small talk over lunch and coffee.

At 6:30 p.m., we had a meeting about the commercials. We decided on the contents of the eight commercials.

\-99/6/2 (Wednesday)

Returned to the "MGS2" project for the first time in a really long time. Worked out the goals and intentions of the Patriots and Solidus. I realized that the plot made no sense. I can't even tell when I wrote these memos. When I look at them again, I feel as if they were imagined by someone else\! 

Nine PS2 tools arrive. We set them up one by one, starting with Okaji (Okamura).

At Takabe's station, about 20 vamps were displayed. It only starts to lag when you have over a hundred people on the screen. I was astonished\!\!\!

Today, I went to the doctor because I was still coughing. The doctor, who looked like a student, said, "it's bad if that medicine doesn't work...." It was a different doctor from the one in the miniskirt last time. There was nothing they could do, so I just got some inhalations done. My symptoms remained the same.

But the side effect of the medicine I was prescribed had a warning labeled "悪心” (malicious motive) on it. The dictionary says that "malicious motive" is "a mind that is bent on doing evil”. I don't think it's right to administer a drug that causes such side effects\! I wonder if I will not be convicted if I commit any crimes after taking this drug. (He’s either joking or misreading, as 悪心 also means nausea as well as malicious motive)

“Codeine Phosphate 100x Doses

Cough suppressant

Side effects: Nausea, drowsiness, constipation

May cause dizziness and lightheadedness; use caution when operating a motor vehicle or other hazardous activities”

Went to the bookstore during lunch break. Purchased the second volume of "Brandenburg". I found a stack of "Battle Royale" in the new book section. It seems to be selling well. The display was intense. I could understand if the book had won the "Horror Award Grand Prize," but this was the first time for me to see a display that took advantage of the fact that the book had failed to win the award.

Went to Radio Nippon in the evening and participated on a program hosted by Kuroda. There wasn’t any pre-taping.

I coughed a lot during recording, but they said it wasn’t a problem. Kuroda and one other host were smoking a ton, so it was really painful, so painful…..

Recorded four weeks' worth of material without understanding what was going on. Finished in about an hour and a half. I take a cab to Akasaka and had a drink at an izakaya in front of Sweet Basil with Scott and Hattori. Took the last train home.

\-99/6/3 (Thursday)

Made a list of MGS2 characters (that need models). It all totaled 35 (including alternative outfits). This is more than double the number of the previous game. We will have to reconsider the number of people working on the character team.

I am trying to sort out the main parts of the story of MGS2, such as the goals of Solidus and the Patriots, the truth of the incident, their motives, etc., but it is not going to be easy. It's not so much that it doesn't make sense as that it's counter-intuitive. It's not clear. The Shadow Moses incident, the tanker sinking, and the Arsenal are not well synchronized. In hindsight, it feels like they’re all jumbled together.

Emma is difficult to handle. Furthermore, the mastermind not Solidus or the Patriots. And Patriots, who have no substance or are thinly disguised.. At what point in the story can we suggest that? This is the difficult part. Even with a linear plot, it would need a considerable amount of polygon cutscenes and radio to make it work. But now there are three times as many reversals with all the characters and events.

Is it impossible?? Is this kind of method possible in the medium of games?

\-99/6/7 (Monday)

The project is not progressing at all. We’ll probably have to stay overnight to get things done at some point.

\-99/6/8 (Tuesday)

Went to Kyobashi to see Run Lola Run. Arrived 10 minutes before the show. The venue was packed. I fell into a pipe chair on the stairs. I settled into a folding chair at the top of the stairs.

The first half was interesting\! German techno synched with Lola’s running, which was fresh from a visual point of view.

However, it’s spoiled in the first 30 minutes. The three "runs" and the foreshadowing of each character do not fit well together. The film felt unfinished.

Decided to write a contribution to Game Criticism on The Faculty and A Simple Plan.

I still haven’t stopped coughing.

\-99/6/14 (Monday)

Had interviews from morning. First, a programmer who dropped out of a doctoral course at Keio University. 27 years old. He made a video where he created all the modeling, textures, and animation (but it was all black) over the course of 8 months. He has plenty of ability, sense, and passion. I was worried about his personality, but I miscalculated completely. He is an impeccably good person. He has experience of starting and leaving a company, and is good with people. His wife serves in the Self Defense Forces. He has already passed the test\!

From noon, I went to Digital Egg in Tsukiji to check the editing of the commercials. After a lot of hard work, we got some good footage. However, my face is not so nice to look at. I wonder what kind of reaction this commercial will receive from the players.

\-99/6/15 (Tuesday)

I went to see "The Faculty" at GAGA. It had laid back direction by Robert Rodriguez and was interesting as a homage to '60s invasion sci-fi. However, the recent advertising is excessive. There is a big gap between the content and the way it is marketed. Will address the subject of the film and either the publicity or the screenplay in Game Criticism. I may decide after I see Simple Plan.

I'm also happy to hear that Austin Powers has surpassed Star Wars in the U.S. I guess Americans are not so bad after all.

In the evening, I went to Digital Egg in Tsukiji for MA on the commercial. Almost finished adding in the onscreen text. First, I put in the SE for the jingle. An old man who looked like a sound engineer brought the tape and cued it up with a squeak.

Otsuka entered the studio at 7:00. I missed him. His glasses (blue colored) are so stylish. I gifted him a MacFarlane figure (Snake) and a T-shirt. I also asked him to feature in my next work. I told him “you might get to speak more than last time”, which seemed to pique his interest. He was happy to hear that the last one sold well. 

As usual, Akio Otsuka wanted to do retakes of his parts. He takes his job seriously.

After Otsuka’s superb narration, it was my turn. As you’d expect from an amateur, once we started for real I got nervous and pronounced things weird. I also used some weird Osaka dialect. I tried a bunch of different versions a few times, but they used the first take. This isn’t something for amateurs.

Cranked out all 9 commercials.

Ate bento with everyone. Finished after 10:00. Somehow, things came out well. My enunciation is better in short bursts. Got some commercial prints from the staff.

\-99/6/16 (Wednesday)

Day 1 of Mori's special discussion. Began with the basics of how to hold a gun, stances, etc. This was very different from looking at books, videos or other materials. It was extremely easy to understand. It was addictive, and so much fun\! It made me forget about work. Mori's lectures are also very well practiced. He has a good style of making everyone think and actually move their bodies. He also takes on an English tone when he gets excited. He says it is because he is always lecturing to foreigners.

He starts explaining the topic of clearing. Today, started from dynamic entry. Mori wrote various situations on the white board. Then we were divided into teams of four and each team was to present its own raid strategy. The final stage of the event was a verification test in the lobby and conference room. It was all very interesting. This lecture inspired me to create a Rainbow Six type game that focuses on rescue, rather than MGS2. 

The day ended with a homework assignment.

I received a call from Muranaka, who told me that he had been able to contact Harry Gregson-Williams himself. He said he is willing to do it. He is very motivated. I will discuss things with Muranaka on Friday. 

Went to the club for the first time in two weeks. It was hard so I did about 5 laps. I weighed in at 64kg.

\-99/6/17 (Thursday)

Yesterday's lecture was so interesting that I added a few more people to the seminar room. 8 people, mainly designers.

Day 2 of Mori's special discussion. First, we started with the homework airplane raid. I thought there would be at most 32 people, but was surprised to hear that there were actually more than 60\. 

Today, we started from yesterday's direct entry then moved onto stealth entry, which is also the main entry. Unlike yesterday, we were in a situation where we did not know where the enemies were. We took our time and cleared the area thoroughly, without making any noise. The slow movement makes it difficult to move, unlike direct entry. The first step is to clear the corners one by one. When I demonstrated the "peek-a-boo" technique that I had seen in a top-secret video shown to me by Mori two years ago, he actually got mad. He said that I shouldn’t move like that. However, it makes for flourishing animation, so I may leave it in the game.

Next, he changed the situation to a T junction, in cases of 2, 3, or more people. It got more and more complicated.

Then we used the seminar room, reception, pub room, and VIP for stealth entry training. We did with terrorists actually set up inside the rooms. In the case of the Matsuhana’s team, I played the role of the villain. I turned off the lights, placed a chair in front of the door so that it would not open all the way and waited to ambush them. The Matsuhana team was distracted by the back of the door, and was completely unaware of me pointing at them from the other side. They were in full view. I waited for about 5 seconds, but they did not notice, so, I shot them dead.

To be honest, I knew the terrain and knew how they were going to attack, so they had no chance. I was also caught in Mori's trap. The door was open, and two enemies inside were chatting with each other inside. I was so distracted by the two that I could not see another person was waiting in the shadows of the passageway.

When the enemy is a special forces unit that is familiar with all kinds of operations, it can be a real mess. The defenders had a tremendous advantage over the attackers.

Had Korepi show an experimental video of clearing (PS). It is different from the real thing but does not seem to be too far off. It should work with some minor adjustments. In particular, if the "small window system" and props such as mirrors and strings are used well, clearing should get across well to the players. Real clearing is done thoroughly, but that doesn’t make for a game. In other words, we want to add in the atmosphere of clearing as much as possible. The main factors are the small tools, the animation, and the course layout.

Mori showed me a program on cable TV about an offshore plant. It is very valuable material. For some reason, Mark Hamill narrated the program. 

Went to Jiyugaoka to see a late show of Horrors of Malformed Men. Was joined by an unusual group of Muraoka, Shin-chan, and Kirioka. It was a nice theater. I was surprised at this movie. The last scene was so great\!\!\! I laughed so hard that my cough came back. It was very moving that this movie was made in the same year as 2001: A Space Odyssey.

\-99/6/21 (Monday)

Since resuming my diary, I have started writing my diary at the office the next morning. Writing a diary on the next day is very good for activating the brain, but if I don't write at home, I can’t draw a clear line between different days. It also means Friday’s diaries get delayed. Something to think about. 

Sasaki's station has started working with the PS tools. Now we can finally produce models on the actual console. The new guy Mogi (Daisuke Mogi) is doing quite well. Nishiki (Rie Nishiki) is still in training.

There is a dispute on the character background for Ghost Babel. When I asked Shin-chan and Nakamura, they said that the characters created by Fusshi are too intense and they aren’t able to transfer their emotions onto them. Shin-Chan said he couldn’t draw them. It is not that the characters are too intense, but rather, the characters are not well-developed. Well, it’s less because of Fusshi and more a reflection of them being boss characters, so it’s not a matter of anyone being in the wrong. It's just a matter of how to make them. In my case, I think about the character setting and the game at the same time, so I don't have any problems. However, in the case of GBC, the planning and scriptwriting were done by different people.

I went home. Watched the NHK Special that I had recorded. Hollywood's marketing and advertising seems to be directly applicable to today's game industry. 

\-99/6/22 (Tuesday)

The designers went out to visit museums. I'm go on the 24th

\-99/6/23 (Wednesday)

The making of the CF is, as expected, going to be done by Konami JPN due to the lack of budget. I started the process of compressing the 7 hours of video into 30 minutes. I'll start compressing the video to about 30 minutes, and then I'll compress it to one-half the original length. I will ask Matsuhana to do the main editing. but it will most likely end up being me doing it. The video quality is low, but it does give off the atmosphere that you’re really there. I will order the rejected footage that could not be used in the CF, and try to insert it well. If we have to do this again, we won’t make any progress on work.

\-99/6/24 (Thursday)

Today is the release date of Integral. I took a peak online but there wasn’t much response.

In the morning, I went to the museum with Matsuhana. I remember visiting the museum once with my son about 2 years ago, but I don't remember if there were any materials on tankers or not.

It was just noon, so we looked for a place to have lunch. The only options were a restaurant inside the museum and a pasta place near a swimming pool, so we walked to the pasta place.

When we entered the restaurant, we were the only customers, or rather, we were the first customers of the day\! I ate my spaghetti with trepidation. 

We looked around the museum. Shin-Chan had asked me to collect the “facts about ships” that were placed 2 pages in each corner. I collected all of them and filed them into 1 book. It took time but I completed 2 sets. 

The section on tankers was well filled with scale models. However, there were no exhibits that showed the internal structure. The staff who actually went to see the tanker told us that they couldn’t see below decks or inside. However the slides and videos, on "how a tanker is made” showed the structure and how it works and greatly deepened my knowledge of the tanker itself. In particular, the Q\&A quiz on tankers was very useful. I would like to incorporate things like the static-electricity-prevention panels into the game. It made me recognize how despite having lived for 35 years, I knew nothing about tankers or the people that work on them.

I attended a screening of The Matrix at the Shibuya Pantheon. A huge crowd\! The line was long when I got there at 6:30. It reminded me of the Tokyo Fantastic Film Festival.

\-99/6/28 (Monday)

Saw a video of Shenmue. It was amazing\!\!\! Yu really is good at what he does\!

It's reckless to make things so detailed. I appreciate the aesthetics and how far they went with it. The technology, the money, and the time needed….wow, that's technology. I’d love to work with them some day.

From 4:30 to 7:00 p.m., had a meeting at SCE on the PS2. 5 people came, including Ueda. 5 with us and another 5 from EAST.

I showed them the experimental videos of MGS2 and explained our progress. I had thought of not showing them any more video at many points, but they seemed to be satisfied with the programming aspects. I was told that the "limits" that Uehara is always talking about are mostly true\! The Q\&A was so in depth it made SCE suffer (as planned) and became incredibly meaningful. Once it finished, we went drinking. They were all straight-laced technician types.

\-99/6/29 (Tuesday)

It looks like VR Time Attack is about to heat up. A lot of people are trying to claim the VR record. Many of the players of MGS are working people and cannot play for a long time unless it’s on weekends.  We’ll cut if off on June 30th and give out prizes. From July, there will be staff challenges.

Did rough editing on the commercial BTS video. Cut it from 7 hours to 38 minutes on the first pass, then put it through DV again and got it to 23 minutes. I'll leave the rest to Matsuhana.

60 frames of marines were displayed at Johnny's station. It was just a walking animation, but at 60 frames, the motion is softer and more fluid. 60 frames is non-negotiable. I think long ago when Douglas Trumbull's invented the virtual-movie, it was over 45 frames, I think? I remember reading a paper that said that above 45 frames, the brain mistakes the image for a real experience. I think it may be more about frame counts than resolution.

Takabe’s station was working on shadow volume methods. There were a lot of problems, so unfortunately, they couldn’t make it semi-transparent\! I’ll have them try other methods.

The evaluation of Z.O.E. is coming up. The competitive action parts are looking good. However, there are many problems. I guess the lack of a director wasn’t a good thing.

Swam at the club. I've been swimming once a week recently, and today I did 10 laps, which is unusual for me. That makes 500 meters.

\-99/6/30 (Wednesday)

At Toyopi's station, I watch still images of Raiden’s animation with his newly articulated model. Although the number of shoulder, elbow, and finger joints has only increased a little, it made a big difference. It was just an animation of Raiden sitting, but his shoulder sagged, giving a different nuance than the previous sitting animation. Where before all we could show was that he was sitting, now it seems possible to show emotions like discouragement. Truly emotional\! I think this would work well for the last cut of Ashita no Joe. Ignoring the details and increasing the number of joints to express things might be the way to go.

Went to Konami TYO from the afternoon. The purpose was to exchange technical information on the PS2 that we were researching. The place was a bit empty, so I showed them the experimental footage of MGS2 that I had prepared. It seemed to have surprised them in its own way.

\-99/7/1 (Thursday)

Had the Z.O.E. evaluation. Was generally well received, with the basic action game elements being very exciting. However, as a game it came off as average. The only remaining selling point of the game, the actual performance, is also questionable. Even so, I’m surprised the MGS team members could put something like this together in such a short time frame\! I feel having made them do everything.

\-99/7/5 (Monday)

In the morning, I wrote an index of revisions for Z.O.E. amendment. It took longer than I thought.

Kano (Kenichiro Kano) arrived from the US. I had hoped to have him introduce himself in English, but he ended up greeting me with a “pardon” in Japanese. Well, I’m excited for what comes next. I’ll need to give him a nickname. The MGS team is a bit like Nanamagarisho. (Name of the police station in a drama series called Taiyo ni Hoero. He’s referencing the banter between the characters.)

In the afternoon, we had a meeting to discuss the guidelines for Z.O.E. We will change it from being “like anime” to “containing the essence of anime.”

However, it seems that the current staff is only confused. Their expressions were rigid Not a good sign. It will be an even bigger burden.

Got the newly articulated model of Raiden on the actual console. His shoulders look beautiful. He moved at 60 frames per second. The movement was quite smooth. The position of the gun holster was quite low on his thigh due to how it connected. There weren’t enough gaps between his toes. The alpha of his hair is still not quite right, a big problem but it’s getting there. Animation work was on the new joints and 60 frames. The current work is taking twice as long due to unfamiliarity with the process, etc. The current situation is that it takes twice as long to do the work as it used to. Will get them down to 1.5 times with perseverance.

Incorporated the "lacquered chopsticks" that are secretly popular in Europe and the U.S. into Rosemary's setting. Handed Shin-chan a newspaper cutout.

\-99/7/6 (Tuesday)

Wrote a contribution for Game Criticism. Since it was on The Matrix, I wrote passionately until it was 3 times the size of my usual contributions. Ever since I went on a diet, my reviews have been boring. However, the last part tying it into games was only a few lines long.

We had a meeting to go over GBC's Ghost Babel. We looked at the map while presenting on the plot. It’s the result of a lot of things turning out differently when there’s a different person planning it. For better or worse, it reflects Shinta Nojiri’s personality. There is a lot of moving around on the map, moving up and down the floor. It's not good. It will struggle in the current Japanese market. But well, maybe it’s just right for the West?

At Okaji’s station, they were working on using pseudo bump maps to create rain ripples. They look good. I haven’t had any pleasant surprises like this recently. Kano stayed late doing overtime.

\-99/7/12 (Monday)

First thing in the morning, I borrowed the seminar room and used a giant projector to watch “METAL WORKS”, an MGS video that which was sent in by a player. This is my third time watching it. I can really feel the love.

Wrote some specs for MGS2 for the first time in a while. I rewrote the vague warning system. I think it's much clearer now. If I can successfully incorporate the new "exploration mode" and other new additions to the game, I'm sure I'll be able to bring out some new nuances in the game. The only thing that could be a problem is the attacks on individual enemy soldier parts. Need to get it done as soon as possible and have it linked to the enemy soldiers for evaluation. Korepi’s station had a whole 25 of the 16 jointed soldiers from the previous game. Had them test how many of the new 22 joint ones they could fit in. They used Raiden for the model. **Also had them do early tests on soldiers using the radio, another big element that could be an issue. I want to give the player a chance for a few seconds before they use their radios, like with the first enemy Bruce Willis took out in Die Hard.**

Takabe’s station was working on extending shadows, but they vanish and reappear when crossing the light sources. Will need to extensively limit their locations.

\-99/7/13 (Tuesday)

Revised the themes of MGS2 once again. Sex "(life)" and "death" in all organisms that evolve through sexual reproduction. The previous game depicted the passing on of genes to offspring according to the laws of nature. The theme of this game is how to pass on to our children those things that cannot be transferred through genetic information, such as souls, thoughts, history, and the environment. On why are these things important, and why they can’t be written into our genes. **For that reason, I made slight alterations to Old Boy’s background. Having attained immortality and continuing an “endless battle”, and his reason to live to whom he passed on his genetics having been erased (his son dying), his existence is neither “life” nor “death,” so he turns to the battlefield for meaning. The former Big Boss and Solidus are the same.**

Nakamura came to work in the afternoon. We had a discussion about Harry Gregson-Williams. He listened to the songs we had selected as examples for our vision for the BGM (excerpts from "The Rock," "Crimson Tide," "Enemy of the State," etc.), and seemed to like them. He was also very enthusiastic about the video of MGS I sent him at the same time, saying that he, “wanted to play it.”

At 4:00, had a meeting to discuss the schedule and status of MGS2. There are too many things that need doing. At this rate, I'll spend most of the year working on the tanker arc, and it may not even become a game. Thanks to the excessive “EE” announcements for animations, models, etc., it’s going to be highly over spec'd. Production will be tough. It doesn’t look like we’ll make it on time. If we screw this up it will be the end of MGS.

\-99/7/14 (Wednesday)

Returned to planning after several months away. Resumed scripting on the tanker arc. It’s interesting. I had forgotten for a while that how fun it can be to write plot and planning documents. I feel like I don't even need money. This is how it feels to be alive\!\! In order to add tempo to the strength of the enemy soldiers and the gameplay, the Gurlukovich soldiers were programmed to be similar to the enemy soldiers from the previous game. This will make Solidus’ troops more effective when assaulting and clearing.

\-99/7/15 (Thursday)

Wrote in events, enemy soldiers, traps, routes, etc. on the map output by Matsuhana to complete a rough map. Also wrote half the script for the tanker arc at the same time. Added in an Olga event so she could leave an impression. At the same time, slightly changed Olga's motive (spy) in the plant arc. Made it so she’s saved by Snake during the sinking of the tanker. She is told by Snake that it was Ocelot who killed her father. **Will have Shin-chan change Olga's design to emphasize her armpit hair. She appears in a tank top.**

Added in quite a lot of elements into the Tanker arc. It will be about an hour and a half worth of content, but should be pretty interesting.

Matsuhana is creating a map on SGI according to the plan map. By the end of the month, we’ll be able to output the map onto the PS2 and check it while creating it.

On Monday the 19th, 12 PS2 tools (with sound) are scheduled to be delivered. We will allocate 3 units to the MGS team, 5 units to the DrumMania team, 4 units to sound, and 1 unit to Z.O.E.

\-99/7/22 (Thursday)

The last time I wrote a diary once I got home was March 2nd, four and a half months ago. It seems to be a good idea to organize my thoughts on the day after I get home. Recently, I’d been writing at the office in the morning while thinking about the previous day's events. It seems that what I’ve been doing up until now is better for keeping my brain active. However, if I do it this way, the diaries on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, and the days before holidays will be missing. Both have their advantages and disadvantages.

When I came in the morning, I found almost a day's worth of e-mails left from yesterday's business trip, oh my\! I almost lost interest in reading them as soon as I opened them. Yesterday's business trip to Hakata was by plane, so it was easy.

I saw rain effects at Okaji's station. They’re alright. They aren’t too heavy apparently. The only thing left to do is to combine various other effects to make it look natural. As planned, 12 PS2 tools arrived during my business trip. At Muraoka's place, I listened to the sound of the PS2. The samples that SCE had prepared were unexpectedly cheap and disappointing. I told Muraoka to follow up the rain effects with sound. The sound of rain pattering in 3D will give a sense of materiality. If it goes well, we can convey that materiality through sound instead of visually.

Negi (Yutaka Negishi) made a rough version of the ship's hold, about 2000 polygons. The size is about 2000 polygons. It captures the size of the ship. Had Korepi place in 56 enemy soldiers. It's \- it's too big\! With only 56 men huddled together in the center of the hold, it won’t make for a game. We can't make the hold smaller. We have to set the frame size to 30 frames so that we can display twice as much.

Wrote up the script for the tanker arc. This will be used as the basis for presentation and map adjustments. As usual when I start writing, the cutscene parts ended up being long.

The Wachowski brothers will be in Japan from August 23rd to 26th. They will be at the premiere screening on the 25th, and want to meet us. This is right when Scott will be away on a business trip to Europe. This is not good\! I wonder if I could get Scott to shift the dates on that trip?

\-99/7/26 (Monday)

Got an email from SONY. It seems that the delivery of AIBO is still a long way off. They can only produce 100 units a day, so it will be around the end of August. My AIBO fever has already cooled off.

In the morning, I watched last week's NHK special "Across the Century" on the projector. Almost everyone in the MGS team watched it together. They didn't seem to be too happy about it.

Bought a copy of Arata Tendo’s old work, "Family Hunting” in the afternoon. I read a bit during my lunch break. Although the book starts with a very shocking scene at the beginning, the theme seems to be the same as that of "Eternal Child." 

I finished the script for the tanker arc and uploaded it to DATA. At the same time, we decided not to use the Verrazanno Bridge as Snake’s drop point, and changed it to the George Washington Bridge. The reason is that dropping from the Verrazano Bridge would have taken us out into the Atlantic Ocean an hour after the tanker sank. I want to start at the George Washington Bridge and end in front of the statue of George Washington in Federal Hall. The materials we gathered will be used when the metal turtle comes ashore.

Took in Hirano’s opinions on the Olga encounter scene and made it so she turns her body after the hold-up. This is what Mori talked about in his lecture after all. I am grateful for such an idea.

After returning home, I happened to watch a program on the making of My Neighbors the Yamadas. Listening to Takahata and Miyazaki talk, I couldn’t agree with them given the position I find myself in now. I couldn’t nod along at Takahata saying that, "It doesn't matter if this film doesn't sell. Even if it doesn't sell, it will be a success as a new animated film\!”. 

\-99/7/27 (Tuesday)

I updated the tanker section and wrote some details. Had a meeting with Matsuhana, Shinkawa, Fukushima, Hirano, but ran out of time and stopped halfway through. The new (3D) from Matsuhana is different from last time and requires revision.

Happened across a copy of Arata Tendo’s Singing Voice of Loneliness, and bought it

Uehara brought his save data of Ape Escape. It was just past the level after Urban City, which I’d been stuck on. Just as I was about to go home, Inoue gave me a memory card where it was 100% beaten. Will this let me use the mecha puncher? (Couldn’t find anything about this, assume he meant the magic punch?)

\-99/7/28 (Wednesday)

Shin-chan bought us action figures (12 inches) of SWAT team members at Yellow Submarine. Mine is a bearded father dressed in black. He is a captain. He is holding a shield. He is pretty good looking\! I put him on my desk. However, Shin-chan’s urban camouflage SWAT team member's joints are tight, but mine are loose. So when I came back to my seat after a while, I saw it had fallen down on the floor. Do dolls have ages too?

From noon, we had a debriefing for the completion of development on Integral. Each of us has our own points to reflect on. Things for us to put to use next time.

Saw a map of the tanker (deck) at Matsuhana's station. Moving it around and looking at it, I could see that it is very expansive. The map is fundamentally different from previous MGS maps, so it feels very empty. They had events and traps built into the map, which is a completely different approach from creating realistic structures that exist in the real world. Is this really what "MGS2" is all about? Is this really the way to go with MGS2? However, there’s no doubt it will be plenty interesting creating a realistic tanker to explore inside.

I went over the videos and photos we collected of tankers again. I am sure the designers must have found it interesting. **The hold Negi made is 1600 polygons, the equivalent of one enemy soldier.** 

Got Raiden’s stealth run to work on console. For some reason it looks uncool.

\-99/7/29 (Thursday)

**Shin-chan told me about something called a scout knife used by Spetsnaz. It has a single bullet in the grip of the knife. Will use it as a sub-weapon for Olga. It will be effective in the tanker arc at the beginning and the suicide scene at the end**. I immediately rewrote Olga's appearance scene in the tanker arc.

Had Toyopi show me some experimental facial animations. The back teeth look scary, but otherwise not bad. If we apply textures, we can make the facial expressions change like in anime. However, it is not likely to look like live-action. Since the beginning, we were never thinking about going in that direction. **Looking at the mouth movements made me want to make a character that chews gum all the time. I'll have Fatman play that role.** 

They got dead bodies to stay behind at Sonopi's (Sonoyama) and Korepi’s station. They look good. When the bodies are left behind, it makes it feel like a battlefield. When the bodies are left behind, it also makes you easier to be discovered than you would think. However, having dead bodies remain makes death animation variations more necessary.

The rain is blended. It's looking pretty good. Morita has completed work on some simple "leg only shadows”.

Had them straighten up Raiden’s animations. Will continue with the sneaky thief concept as is. The concept of "this is the situation" will continue as it is. Will think about the problem with the low camera height in 1st person mode later.

**On the way back home, I thought about scrapping Johnny and Data as characters. Currently, there are too many characters, and it is not possible to make each of them unique. The strategy is to increase the number of times main characters appear by eliminating supporting characters. Therefore, the role of Johnny will be assigned to Olga. The Colonel introduces Olga, under the name "Mr. X," and at first she’ll be a collaborator (spy). She is on the patriot side.**

**Also changed Rose from being a newscaster, and gave her Data’s role. The patriots (the colonel) abduct Rose, an office worker at a brokerage firm, and force her into the data role in order to intimidate Raiden. Rose isn’t there in person, only on the radio. Rose calls Raiden by his real name until the end and is concerned about his well-being. After the midpoint, Raiden realizes that his memories of her are missing. In the latter half, he learns that "Colonel" and "Doc" were artificial intelligence, and wonders whether or not Rose is too. This is kind of a return to the original plan. In the end, Rose tells him she is pregnant. Raiden reunites with her and names the child "Dave”.**

Raiden was unable to protect Olga's child, something else he carries with him.

\-99/8/3 (Tuesday)

Review scheduling and staffing for MGS2. All elements must be in place by the end of the year 2000\. The character team seems to have things more or less under control. The problem is the background team. It is becoming difficult to divide the same quantity and number of 30 types as before. Before, the map units were very small one-load maps. That is not the case this time. We can't make a schedule. And what to do with the high polygon models? Just shelve them for now. And the biggest problem is motion capture. How do we capture it? And what to do with what we have captured? I have no idea what to do with what I have taken. The last time we did this, I figured out that we could do about 50 takes of shooting in a day. How many days will it take?

**I have an idea how Solidus can use the current president's ID. Ocelot has a transplant of Liquid's right arm in the setting. So he tries to transplant the president’s right arm and pass biometrics with his living right arm. This would allow him to fire all U.S. nuclear weapons.**

Downloaded the Ape Escaper minigame onto my pocket station late at night. It's a game that you mostly just watch, but it is quite interesting. In the middle of the night, my son woke up and played Ape Escape. He seemed to be happy.

\-99/8/4 (Wednesday)

In the morning, I said goodbye to my son. My wife and son are flying back to my parents' house at 2:00pm today. I'll be single for a while.

In the morning, I had a meeting with Matsuhana to discuss the schedule and budget for MGS2. We will make a rough schedules for each month, but it will be very difficult if anything is late.. It is difficult because outside creators are also involved. The schedule, budget, and personnel plan will be reviewed again and submitted. 

I called my parents' house at around 7:00 p.m., but the phone went straight to voicemail. I went to buy lunch with Muraoka. It had been a while since. It really has been a while since I’ve had ten-don bento.

Went home. It was lonely with no one around. I took a bath, then drank beer, while watching Cube. The idea was great, but the direction was not as good as I expected.

\-99/8/5 (Thursday)

From today, I'm living alone. When I woke up this morning, I realized that I had no breakfast. I should have bought some bread or something last night. I opened the refrigerator and thought I would have some jelly or yogurt, but there was nothing inside. It seems that my wife emptied it out because it would all go bad. I had no choice but to buy a rice ball (grilled cod roe) at a convenience store in front of the station. I feel empty.

At work, I chewed my meager breakfast and looked at my e-mail. 

**I start working on concluding the plot of MGS2. I'm forgetting the details. I'm trying to reassemble the plot, but the schedule is pretty strict, so I can't really extend things out. I also have to delete parts of the characters' backgrounds that are too complicated. Raiden's past, for example, was one of the first things on the list. Fortune and Vamp are hard to incorporate into the story.**

Had a discussion about the cover of the book "Budo/Bujutsu" published by Shin-Kigensha. The person in charge seemed quite sensible, so I left the meeting after about an hour. Shinkawa is scheduled to submit the material at the end of the day.

Left work at 5:30 p.m. and went to Shinbashi. Had an early dinner (light meal) with Ueno at a tea shop near Tokuma Hall. I wanted a proper meal but there wasn’t time, so we gave up. We arrived at the venue around 6:15 p.m. There were quite a few people in the lobby, and to my surprise, the venue was full\!\! I ended up in a spare chair in the back row.

Went home. After taking a bath, I watched Deep Rising. It was so interesting\! I didn't expect it to be this interesting\! Stephen Sommers, you've really outdone yourself\! No wonder he was chosen to direct The Mummy. The script, the dialogue, etc. were a lot like The Mummy. He is a director to watch. The actress was good. I've seen her somewhere before, but I can't remember where. I can really use it for reference with the effects in the tanker arc of MGS2.

\-99/8/6 (Friday)

Bought another rice ball (salmon with mayonnaise)" at a convenience store this morning. and ate it at work.

In the morning, I had a meeting about the schedule and budget of Z.O.E.

Started plotting the plant arc. It will be quite long. The big ending (reveal) in the 2nd half is just going to be a lot of talking no matter what. I don't want to make it a polygon cutscene, so it will be a 1st person cutscene. It would be a pain otherwise.

**The final clash between Solidus’ and Gurlukovich’s forces is looking impossible to go, so I scrapped it.  How unfortunate. I had wanted to have them face off in the background while there’s a boss fight in the foreground.**

Morita seems to like movies a lot. He can program too, and he has good taste. I am looking forward to what he does. I have high expectations for the wave effects. Kyle Cooper is the right man for the job. He can program, has good taste (he has a design background), likes movies, and speaks English.

Our end of term gathering started at 5:00 p.m. We all gathered in the seminar room, and before we knew it, it was packed full of people. Many couldn't fit in the room. In 1996, there weren’t even 30 people.

I got drunk because I drank beer at the gathering. I had no choice but to give up on going to the pool. I bought a “deluxe tempura shrimp rice ball set” bento box by myself and ate it. The lady gave threw in some skewers and gave me a discount.I feel like I'm back in a boarding house.

At night, got the textures of the tanker arc to appear on screen. The polygonalized version of the actual structure looks very convincing.

After returning home, I took a bath and did laundry while watching Lost in Space. The designs were innovative, but it was oppressively boring.

If I remember correctly, the director is the same guy that directed Predator 2\. I don't like Kyle’s ending credits, though they are elaborate….

\-99/8/18 (Wednesday)

Obon vacation is over. It was quite a busy summer vacation. I was able to have a lot of fun with my son.

Since I took my summer vacation a bit later, my first day back was on Wednesday

As expected, on my desk were letters sent to me, summer greeting cards, and billing statements that needed my signature. I opened my email and saw it stuffed to the brim too\!\!\! All of this in just two days. I'm worn out. I handled it all through the morning and wrote a planning application for Ghost Babel. It was already past 3:00 p.m.

Start working on wrapping up the plot. Unlike on holidays, there were a lot of people around, so I got distracted and didn't get much done. 

Matsuhana’s station was working on the tanker, rain, and enemy soldiers. The small textures were stretched, giving a strong N64-like impression. It still needs work. As for Raiden, no choice but to give up on his stooping animation. There are still problems around his feet. 

With such a tiered structure of upper and lower levels, 1st person shooting looks fun. However, the question is what to do with the sight. I don't want there to be a "+" target like in other games. I want to stick to it truly being 1st person when using the guns. The reason why I originally adopted 1st person was because I wanted to aim at targets with a sight. If we are going to bend the concept, we should just drop it.

A 35,000-yen stone statue has arrived at Johnny's seat. It has a micro dick between its legs. There’s no doubt it will break within a few weeks. But, if it helps us make a good model even a little bit, then it’s cheap. We are planning to buy one more. I’ll have them smashed to pieces when development ends.

Most of the programmers are here. The ones that went on a business trip to SIGGRAPH are back, so for the first time in a while, things are bustling. Shin-chan and Toyopi are still on break.

Morita showed me some sea surface effects. Apparently he made the texture of the sea surface and the waves himself, and it looks incredibly good. I look forward to his future as a programmer. He has that necessary ability in a programmer to create surprises with ideas and ingenuity in a given environment. There are very few people who can do that.

It is not about the technology, but the ideas behind the technology.

Held a watch party for Deep Rising at 6:30 p.m. in the seminar room.

I left at the beginning and went to the sports club. I got back just as it was ending.

I went home and watched Arlington Road. It was interesting. The last scene left me feeling uncomfortable, similar to how I felt watching Kurt Russell's Breakdown. Kyle Cooper's OP wasn’t all that great. The idea was too simple.

\-99/9/19 (Thursday)

I forgot to buy bread for breakfast last night, so had to make do with Weider in Jelly again this morning. I got a phone call from my son just before I left home.

**I'm going to bring back the "stealth camera," that I had previously scrapped.**

**I think it's more innovative and effective than the remote-controlled missile. It will add gravitas when rescuing Emma and in boss fights. It is interesting but very difficult to pull off. I have a feeling that it will end up being scrapped at the last minute.**

**I think I will add in an event with a giant shark. Sharks are a huge trope for anything set in the ocean, but I’m doing it anyway.** Renny Harlin’s new film Deep Blue Sea releases next month.

Zelda is casting its shadow on the tanker. The current lagging is due to the lack of model segmentation, so we’ll make the background processing much faster.

The 1st person shooting was difficult to do, so changed the 1st person button to "R1". It controls very well. Resident Evil players are probably used to it. However, the buttons for quick change and the button for looking into the viewfinder when in 1st person are gone, so it needs review.

I went to see Eyes Wide Shut with Muraoka. It was very crowded.

I had heard a lot of bad reviews, but I thought it was interesting. For 2 and a half hours, I was immersed in Kubrick's world without falling asleep. Even at 70 years old, he is still a genius. No matter what frame you look at, the composition is superb. The lighting is amazing. Like in the bar scene, etc. I didn't expect it to be such an easy-to-understand film. I’ll have to re-watch Kubrick’s previous work.

\-99/8/23 (Monday)

Summer vacation is over, and I will be living with my family again from Saturday. 

**I'm thinking about specifications for "breath-holding" controls when underwater. The idea is that when your O2 gauge runs out under water, you have to you hit the action button repeatedly to hold your breath a little longer. The goal is to experience the sensation and pain of holding one's breath in water for real. It is difficult to control, but there are no games that can reproduce this sensation. In an event where you have to pass underwater, conventional games have you try to find the shortest distance route. If you fail the game starts over again from the starting point. MGS2 will not be like that, but instead be so that at points where the route becomes uncertain, you have to repeatedly press the button and make use of your extra breathing time to find the course. If you use the button presses well, your range will expand and deepen extensively.** 

**Wrote weapon specifications. I put it in the specification documents, but I think it's best to get rid of underwater weapons (guns). I am concerned about the guns being fired from ambiguous positions in the water.**

They were testing the fixed camera at Matsuhana’s station. It’s quite good. Also, the 1st person and the movements when turning corners well implement Mori’s lessons on clearing. It adds a new gameplay feel and enjoyment not found in the last game. It allows for an infiltration method of advancing, stopping, peaking in 1st person, eliminating targets with your gun, then advancing further.

\-99/8/25 (Wednesday)

I met the Wachowski brothers and Geof Darrow at the Park Hyatt in Shinjuku. When we first came face to face, Geof called me “Kojima sensei\!”

All three are very nice people. Soft-spoken, intelligent, and nice guys. Nerd masters are the same everywhere. Somehow we seemed to be on the same wavelength. We got along well.

The interview room was even set up. A monitor was embedded in the curvature of the metallic wall, with footage of The Matrix playing on Betamax.

\-99/8/30 (Monday)

My AIBO finally arrived. When I opened the box, it was bigger than I had expected. It seems a lot needs to be done to get it working, so I’ll put it off until tomorrow.

\-99/8/31 (Tuesday)

I activated my AIBO. It’s truly the same majestic feeling as if giving birth to a child.

It is very noisy when it is left in automatic mode. Just constantly beeping for some reason. I can’t get any work done line this. I should take it home after all. 

 Uploaded a fixed version of the weapons and equipment.

I went to the preview of Cascadeur. It's not interesting. I don't think I'll be able to make an article out of it either.

It is a strange film made by a German director who grew up watching Hollywood films and shot on a German budget with a German crew. The jokes, dialogues, tempo, etc. are like Hollywood action, but it doesn't seem to fit the national character and it’s not funny.

\-00/11/1 (Wednesday)

It is November as of today. The PICT on my cell phone screen has changed to an autumn leaf pattern. It’s already autumn. No, maybe it’s winter.

I started writing this diary again. I opened my folders and looked over the development diary again. To my surprise, there has been a gap of one year and two months since the last entry on August 31st of last year. It was hard to write my diary at home because my home e-mail terminal is now VAIO. I can’t write text the way I picture it in my head on Windows. It’s something I could get done if I got used to it, but right now, when it comes to writing planning documents and story, the subtle “sensation” of it is important. If my fingers stop, my thoughts stop. I’ll continue pushing through on Mac for the time being.

I just can’t write my diary after coming home every day. It would run late into the night among other things.

Even with these excuses taken into account, I’m shocked it’s been over a year.

From now on, I will write down the day's events on that same day before going home. Anything that happens after that, I will recall and write down the next morning. Writing down the events of the last few days is apparently very good for stimulating the brain.

Today, I finished adjustments on the demo version and return to work the plant arc. I would have liked to stay in the reception room, but it wasn’t available, so I had to do things at my desk. First of all, I finalized the selection specifications at the beginning. Some staff members can’t read anything that isn’t split up into specification documents, so will embed those into the script. 

A proposal came from the CP department for 12-inch dolls. It appears they are planning to make dolls for MGS.

I bought the 15th volume of MONSTER and went home. Once again, it built up to something then just ended.

\-00/11/2 (Thursday)

It was raining again this morning. Tokyo Fantastic is this evening, so I was going to go home for a while, but with the weather being what it was, I decided I’ll go directly from the office. We planned to meet up at Shibuya Pantheon at 23:00. So I’ll make it on time if I leave the office at 10:30 p.m.

The blacklight specifications weren’t coming through, so I decided to strengthen them. I'll also set them up in corners and recesses on the 2nd floor. Now they should be harder to find regardless of whether you turn right or left. If you destroy a breakable light, the black lights will turn on.

Once the demo version was finished, I began work on the tanker and plant arcs. At the beginning of the new year, the staff from Z.O.E .will join us. We need to build up a foundation by then. I also need to fix the plot before the recording session in December.

I was supposed to be in the reception room today working on the plot, but unfortunately I had to give that up to do checks on the Z.O.E. ROM. Up until shooting the EPS supports.

I bought takoyaki and a shrimp tempura rice ball at Mitsukoshi and ate them. The takoyaki was delicious. Shin-chan and Toyopi had recommended it.

Swam at the club. It was emptier than usual, so I took more time to swim. Maybe that's why I'm already getting sleepy. Will I be able to keep the sleepiness at bay at Tokyo Fantastic?

\-00/11/4 (Saturday)

I went to the office today. I worked on the scripts. Especially the plant and tanker sections at the beginning needed fixing.

Stephen Hunter's Tapestry of Spies is boring. A new work by Arata Tendo was released. Glenn Meade's new novel is also coming. I need to finish reading this quickly.

No one is at this bloc today. For the first time in a while It looks like I'll be able to get some work done.

Around 3:00 p.m., the story team came to work. If aiming for a break, looks like the morning is best. 

**Wrote specifications for the opening act. Thinking about it, we may have a CESA by the end of next year. We already have an "M" rating in America. If that is the case, there will be no need to ask the player's age at the beginning. Essentially, blood can be turned on or off regardless of player age.**

I bought a copy of Arata Tendo’s new work, Overflowing Love. It was selling quite well. It seems that the first edition will be sold out by next week.

\-00/11/6 (Monday)

I started to revise the plant arc for the first time in a while. I had to spend the morning doing email, payments, and meetings, so I entered the reception room in the afternoon. I had reserved it from the morning, but they might get mad that I didn’t really use it. I revised things up to the bridge. Scrapped the exchange event with Snake. I'm going to make it so if you have a razor, it will auto give the razor to Snake. It’s not interactive, but I don’t want things to be sluggish after a long cutscene, so I'm going to omit it. 

I have been thinking of cutting down on the specifications recently.

Page 143:

Got back comments from KOE about the sale of demo versions of MGS2. In Europe, Z.O.E. is apparently more anticipated than Onimusha. If MGS2 is included on top of this, then SCEE will pay for a commercial. This is wonderful. This is a great opportunity. I want to release it by the end of this fiscal year, no matter what it takes. 

A new demo version disc was burned at 9:00pm. When I checked it, it crashed during the fight against Olga. The radio is also buggy. It's not ready yet.

Added subtitle descriptions to the tutorial at the beginning. There was too much information distracting the player, so I removed the description windows for weapons and equipment. Will keep the demo like this for now.

They didn’t burn any discs for Z.O.E. today. I had no choice. I had no choice but to play the version included with Dengeki D.

Tapestry of Spies wasn’t interesting. I’m disappointed that The Master Sniper was his only good one.

\-00/11/7 (Tuesday)

**There’s something wrong with my stomach again. I've been terribly constipated for the past month, and I also have stomachache.** It’s around my left side. It will be harsh if it lasts a long time like before. I try not to think too much about it and power through, but it does get to me.

\-00/11/8 (Wednesday)

Today, we monitored MGS2 with the WEST development assistant. It was Hara, Arikawa, Kitamura, and section head Nakano, the current director. Each of them spent about 2 hours, and just like with the monitoring session at SCE, we gave them a printout to write down their impressions. 

Hara, who rarely plays games, beat it on very easy. Unlike at the SCE meeting, he was the first one to teach me how to operate the game. It was even easier than I thought. Unlike at SCE, while Nojiri taught him the controls in the beginning, there are things in an action game that can’t be taught. The controls, which were the element that worried me the most, were alright, which is a small relief.

Lip syncing is now included in the polygon cutscenes. Expressions and lip syncing make a difference. All that’s left now is gaze direction and blinking. Time will tell how far we can take things. Cypher also looks good.

\-00/11/9 (Thursday)

My stomach has hurt since this morning to the left of my belly button. It’s the same place that hurts. Pushing with my finger hurts too.

**Decided to stop using the trick of changing the voice of Pliskin to Banjo Ginga in the plant arc.**

I’ll have Otsuka play the role from the beginning, even if it makes things obvious. Did revisions up until the ninja encounter. I couldn't stay in the reception room today either.

Had a product presentation on Z.O.E. at KMJ in Shinjuku. It was supposed to start at 6:00 p.m., but things were on standby by the time I arrived because the meeting ended early. What a difference from the other day\! I got the impression that the participating members were full of anticipation. 

Used a disc to explain the gameplay of MGS2 without any lies. The game was played without any explanations. Used it for almost 30 minutes right up until before the battle against Olga. After the explanation, there was a round of applause, what a reception\! I heard people say “it’s amazing” on their way out. Tomorrow, only Okamura is scheduled to travel to Kobe. I hadn’t planned on doing a MGS2 presentation, but it might be better to record something on DV and give it to him.

\-00/11/10 (Friday)

My stomach still hurts today. It's getting worse.

I played a read only disc of Z.O.E.

Added vibrations to the radio, but it doesn't make the camera shake. Discussed it with Mizupin and had him explain the mechanism of camera shaking with the demo tool. The animation in the radio conversations is coming together little by little. Shin-chan also put in some lighting. There is still one more thing to do. Will look forward to adjusting the focus and adding effects.

\-00/11/12 (Sunday)

They burned the first disc for the plant arc, so I played it. Up to Shell 1\. I can't seem to get down to the basement of the center of the plant. Well, too many enemies would find me there. It's also hard to understand the map. Especially the layered structure of the heliport and the armory is not intuitive. The hierarchical structure of the armory is not intuitive. It is hard to see where they are connected. It's like a maze.

Modified the scriptment based on the disk. 3 enemy soldiers is too hard for the first EV hall.

\-00/11/13 (Monday)

Checked Plant \#2. As expected, the heliport and the armory are hard. Removed the upper camera in the stairwell, and made various other revisions. and the armory are still painful. The hostage room in the central building and B3, are visible now, but it’s not good. You can’t get a feel for the density of the hostages. Will leave the hostage animations for now and decide on the size first.

Played the read only disc of Z.O.E. My stomach hurt again\!

Had Mori play the demo. He was caught a lot and got a game over, but he gave a good review of it.

Had dinner with Mori at a yakiniku restaurant in front of Ebisu station. Being both busy and not feeling well, I stopped at 2 beers.

\-00/11/14 (Tuesday)

Got to meet Director Gakuryu Ishii\!\!\! My dream came true at last\! He was a nice guy, and complimented MGS\!

Ah, what a good day.

\-00/11/15 (Wednesday)

Added in an interesting video (Basic Action). The screen is small, but it's easy to understand when you see it in motion. The video is divided into beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels. Will consider adding a new range of videos in the future. I was thinking of adding a movie of the staff's faces, but decided not to. Matsuhana was already rolling the camera. I am sorry about that.

Did a full playthrough check of Z.O.E. together with Kitao and Kobayashi. It froze at points, preventing progression. Also, the Tyrant freezes sometimes. I have not seen the Anubis at the end yet.

Started on the radio drama from after the battle with Olga.

We’re just about to upload the master, and I had a meeting on Saturday and Sunday, so I have not been writing in my diary for a while.

There was an article in Aera about the poor performance of PS2.

Played through Z.O.E. to the end. It still needs work, but is finally coming together.

\-00/11/21 (Wednesday)

Will check the master version. If there are no problems, I will submit the master version tomorrow morning. 

Had a board meeting over lunch. Followed by a production meeting ....... so couldn’t get anything done today.

Did a full playthrough of Z.O.E. Had to stop halfway through due to freezing and then start again from the midpoint through to the end.

Looks like Toyopi is getting married. I’m so happy for him\! The wedding is planned for April. I remember him interviewing at HG before Konami JPN was even formed. His brand new suit still had the labels on it. That was 5 years ago.

\-00/11/22 (Wednesday)

Heard from Okamura that the CS Osaka product presentation held yesterday was very well received.

In the morning, Matsuhana took the master of the trial version to SCE. I wanted to go, but decided not to since Ueda isn’t around in the morning. I wanted to give it to him directly. Since I can’t I’ll let others handle it this time. I know this is something that shouldn’t happen, but there could be a resubmission of the master.

Checked Z.O.E. and flagged the parts with missing sound effects. It was frustrating how many there were. At this rate, I won't be able to go back to work on MGS2. 

Handed over the materials for the figures to an external party. There will be a toy fair in New York next February. There will be a toy fair in New York next February. They want to make a big announcement of MGS2 there. 

I asked Shin-chan to go to a meeting about the prototypes around Mid-December.

I had planned to go too, but I can’t with Z.O.E. being in this state.

Raiden, Fortune, and Solidus will be kept under wraps until the game is released. 

I will also tell them about the cardboard boxes for the game. They are going to send us a full-size cardboard box as a sample 

Had a discussion on promotion for Z.O.E.

We celebrated launch of the trial version at a chanko-nabe restaurant in Ebisu. The plan was only for the story team to come, but the animation team also participated. The programming team will celebrate separately in Shibuya. 

Everyone went to karaoke as an after party. It was difficult to hear my own voice because the echo was too strong. 

Went home with Kaneyoshi.

\-00/11/24 (Friday)

Did a full check of Z.O.E. Was able to get through without any stops. There are no cutscenes included at the moment, but I felt relieved. Now we need to see how far we can raise the quality within schedule, but can’t expect any miracles. Will put special emphasis on the production and sound.

Thought about what to do for the 1 minute 30 second opening cutscene of Z.O.E. (with a Lantis song playing). If I keep editing it like this, I won’t be able to get back to work on MGS2. Why\!\!???

The temporary background for Emma's sniping event has been completed and was being shown at Yoshiike's station. The PSG1 has a zoom function, so that players can grasp the situation around them. 

Played the DVD version of Z.O.E. for the first time. Experience the flow from the introductory OP movie to the game.

**My left side hurts from my ribs down to my hip bone. It even hurts when I sneeze. It also hurt when I was swimming.**

\-00/11/26 (Sunday)

I came to the office to work. Tomorrow I have a meeting on revising the schedule for the plant arc. I will prepare the preparatory materials before the end of the day.

Yesterday, I went to ROBODEX 2000 held at Yokohama Pacifico. The event was broadcast on TV, so there were a lot of people there. Lines like Tokyo Disney Land. When I arrived at the venue, a staff member was shouting through a megaphone that, "It takes 2 hours to buy a ticket and another 2 hours to get in\!” I tried to give up and leave, but my son insisted that, “It’s a lie\! He’s lying\! He's lying\!”, so we kept waiting in line. As you’d expect, the repeated warnings on the megaphone led many to get out of line.

To my surprise, we were able to get into the venue in under 3 hours instead of 4\. I was impressed by my son's reading of the situation. However, the venue was packed with people. My son was so excited as he ran around the venue. He looked especially interested in the AIBO. I think I'll bring home my AIBO, Ranamn, which I left at the office. It almost brought tears to my eyes to see my beloved P2 and P3 in the flesh. However, ASIMO was so crowded that I unfortunately couldn't see it with my own eyes. I could only watch it indirectly on a monitor that was being relayed by a camera at the venue. I am about the same height as my son, so I couldn't see anything beyond the crowd. I wish I could have seen it with my own eyes. Same with SONY's humanoid robot (SDR).

But well, at least I could feel that it was there beyond the crowd.

Perhaps because I was influenced by Robodex, I started up my AIBO, Ranman, for the first time in a year. It still worked. It moved somewhat awkwardly, but it was not broken. Will take it home at the end of the year. Until then, I have to move it frequently and let the AIBO grow to some extent. Of course, there’s no comparison to the AIBO2 we saw at the event, given how limited its motions are. It lacks expressive power.

Made slight adjustments to the scriptment and went back home. From today, Fussy will start working on the plot. What will he cook up with my scriptment?

Stephen King’s The Stand is tough to read. There are a lot of characters and their backgrounds are too detailed. From what I’ve read so far, there are some character arcs I’m excited to see, but it’s frustrating.

\-00/11/27 (Monday)

I restarted AIBO in the morning. It seemed a lot more energetic. It scratches its head and its movements have become more varied. Even though it was sleeping I wonder if its movements are on a timer.

**Decided to scrap Chinaman. It’s a sad thing to cut, but necessary to reduce model and boss creation time. Will make the man in the cockpit and the man who stabs Emma be Vamp instead. Decided to also connect the boss fight pool prepared for the Chinaman fight. It was a hard decision.**

Had a general meeting on MGS2. The seminar room was almost full.

We received a fax from SCE on the master check of the demo version. No go\! We didn’t get an OK on the first try. There were mistakes with the English writing, and they wanted us to stop using the phrase "returns can be made at ......" in the description of the demo version. Too bad.

\-00/11/28 (Tuesday)

**After going home for the night and thinking about it, I realized that there are still too few boss fights. Decided to use the Chinaman boss fight as is with Vamp. The bottomless pool for boss fights will also remain the same. Considering that Chinaman and Vamp are both clever knife-wielders, they did overlap as characters to an extent. This means that Vamp will appear 5 times, the most of any boss.**

**At Shinchan’s suggestion, changed the Gurlukovich soldiers’ guns in the plant arc from AK-74U to Abakan AN-94. However, VIP soldiers will also have AKs as before. Raiden will therefore be able to obtain AKs.**

**Also, the OICW used by high-tech soldiers (robocops) will be replaced by the M4. They would have been a pain to program, so we changed it to the safer option. The OICW is interesting to look at, but all the animations would have had to be reworked. Another tough decision today.**

The hostage room was turned into an event hall at Negi's station for some reason. It was decorated for the president's speech. It was not unreasonable, so I decided to give it the go ahead as is. I’ll accept changes at the site that turn out to be for the better. However, recently, a lot of this stuff is being done independently at the site level without being reported or approved. In addition, the content of the project is not known to all the staff members. Moreover, the content of the project is not taken into consideration at all. **The reason for this is, unsurprisingly, that many staff members have not read through the specifications or the scriptment, the bible of the whole project. When asked why, they reply "It's too hard to read them.” I always think, "Why don't you quit production then?"**

I made a remaster for submission to SCE. I will resubmit it tomorrow morning. 

\-00/11/29 (Wednesday)

Before going to bed last night, I re-read my interviews in the previous MGS mook book, story book, strategy book, etc. What I said, and what I want to do in the future hasn’t changed. However, I found that even though I was in bad physical condition two years ago, I was still in high spirits. I am embarrassed that I haven't changed, but my physical and especially mental health has become more stable.

I am taking two kinds of oral medicines (anti-allergic medicines) that I got from the hospital, so my skin feels good. It may be just be in my head, but my skin feels normal. 

Matsuhana took the remaster of the demo version to SCE.

Estimating the gameplay time for MGS2, it’s 1 hour and 30 minutes for the tanker arc, 2 hours and 30 minutes until the plant bomb demolition, 1 hour from the central building to Shell 2, 2 hours from the Shell 2 central building to the snipers, 1 hour for arsenal, and 1 hour for the ending......, for a total of about 10 hours. It's longer than the last game.

I arranged the structure of the plant section. The first half is stealth, the second half is an event. The boss battles are also reasonable. Not looking too bad. The question is whether this will happen as planned.

Played Z.O.E. The sound effects I had ordered were added in, but they’re unpleasant. The sound design is not as good as it should be. The direction is not fully realized.

The difficulty scale is too light, so I instructed them to adjust the parameters for enemy guards, encounters, evasion timers, etc. The 2P Nate has become boring again.

Shin-chan, without any instructions from anyone, has added in lighting to the Z.O.E. stages. As you’d expect from Yoji Shinkawa. I reviewed it all today\! It seems that the CD will be printed tomorrow, so I am looking forward to seeing it.

\-00/11/30 (Thursday)

It's the last day of November. It is remarkably cold again today.

Revised Vamp’s boos fight. Made it so Vamp is able to escape into the water, but Raiden can’t enter the pool. At this point, Raiden has most of his weapons. So, he will be able to devise ways to fight back strategically with a variety of weapons. It won’t be that only a limited number of weapons and equipment will be effective, but that the characteristics of each weapon will be applicable, allowing players to do things their own way. This is similar to the fight with Raven in the last game. Also, there weren’t any scenes or events where the 1st person punch was effective, so made it so you can aim for Vamp’s weak spot (his sides).

There’s a joint event with Snake in the Arsenal corridor. but I am very uneasy about the programming. With the enemy soldier intelligence being what it currently is after a year of work, we need to decide whether to change the specifications or not as soon as possible. The number one thing that shouldn’t be done in game design and planning is to leave things up to the programmer's ability. Especially smart enemies and non-player characters.

Considered the underwater specifications again. Will separate the surface and underwater with forced animation. and as much as possible, they should be created as separate stages. 

At night, I watched Mad Max 2 on TV for the first time in a while. The dubbing had changed, and Mel Gibson was dubbed by Koichi Yamadera. I've already seen the movie more than 10 times, but it's still interesting no matter how many times I see it.

Page 144:

The direction is amazing. The use of the camera, the angles ...... The most amazing part is the direction of the first half. We already see the setting and the situation from the same point of view as Max. 1st person and binocular view footage. Max's experience is directly connected to the audience's experience. Young George Miller was just too good\!

\-00/12/1 (Friday)

It is already December. The last month of this century. Things will be decided for Z.O.E. and MGS2 this December. How will I spend it? How we live will greatly affect the year 2001\.

FAX from SCE. Got approval for the master of the trial version without any issues. That was over too quickly, but it’s good, it’s good. It’s a relief. All that's left is Z.O.E.

Played Z.O.E. The difficulty adjustment is still not quite right. I want there to be more depth to the game once you get used to the action. Duplicated today's version and distributed it to the MGS team. I'm going to try to get the data. 

\-00/12/4 (Monday)

Went to two L’Arc-en-Ciel concerts in a row on Saturday and Sunday. Naturally, I’m tired.

Gave a pep talk to the Z.O.E. team. People outside often scold me, saying, "If you protect your staff too much, you won't get anywhere.” Craftsmanship is something that’s cool, but not cool. This is something that young people from the age where the video game industry is in the limelight don't seem to understand. There are few people who say, "I came to the game industry because I want to make things.” Most of them are in the game industry because it's lucrative and attracts attention. And they start calling themselves "creators" immediately after joining the company, even though they have not yet created anything. 

Played the hold segment. The neck exercises and "heart pounding" events look good. However, we may have to pull the camera back a lot to get it to work. Pulling the camera back is demanding on the display. The number of soldiers decreases. In addition, when the camera is pulled back, the number of people appears to be smaller. 

Raiden's sneaking animation is good.

\-00/12/5 (Tuesday)

**Wrote revisions in the scriptment for the Fortune fight. Emphasized the invader game aspect of it without having Fortune move too much.** 

Talked with Oshii (Mamoru Oshii) about Avalon. We met again for the first time in two years. He had grown a beard. It looks good on him. It must be nice to look good with a beard. I’m jealous. We talked from 3:00 p.m. to almost 7:00 p.m. in our seminar room. I talked from 3:00 p.m. to almost 7:00 p.m. at our seminar room. I also played MGS2 in front of Oshii. I had him for almost half a day. He seems to be preparing for his new work. The public announcement is still a long way off, I can't imagine where I’ll be at that time now. Now is a difficult time for me (with things not yet being completed), it’s the opposite of last time. Last time, Oshii was caught up in the labyrinth of G.R.M. (Garm Wars), and this time, I’m the one that’s complaining.

I was shown footage of San Francisco and Los Angeles, which I was unable to visit. I was surprised to hear that the footage of MGS2 was received well at overseas studios.

At the end, Oshii said to me, "Please make an adventure. Kojima, you’re a worldly person, and this (MGS) isn’t good”….. I guess.

I watched a little of L’Arc-en-Ciel’s concert on Yahoo relay.

Problems occurred with the PAL conversion. The high-speed animation used for the helicopter and cypher rotors slowed down, causing bugs. Used an alternative solution to overcome it.

Various CS product presentations were held in Akihabara and Sendai today. Okamura went to the one in Sendai and Matsuhana went to the one in Akihabara, presenting Z.O.E. and the MGS2 trial version. Asking them how it went, they said it was well received, but the response was not as clear as that of E3. 

\-00/12/6 (Wednesday)

Revised the scriptment. It was a peaceful day. I've somehow managed to reduce the number of captured scenes in Emma's cutscenes. I'm going to put in some 60's melodrama style direction, like with the sunset footage.

Nojiri's station was adding in a pole sliding animation for the hold. It was not very interesting. It’s a half-baked plan (was it Matsuhana's idea?) Something additional is needed. I asked them to pull back the camera extensively so the commander-in-chief and the soldiers all fit on screen.

Yoshihashi from the CP Division came by. It was about the 12-inch dolls for MGS. He wants to release four dolls apparently. The lineup is Snake, Liquid, Meryl, and Wolf.

They all use the same model, and only the heads are swapped out, so the height and proportions must match to a certain degree. This is why those characters were chosen. The number of dolls of this type sold is said to be 2,000-3,000. The prototype maker of this type of doll is a Japanese person. Since the model prototype maker is Japanese, I'm OK with the commercialization of the doll. I’ll leave the rest of the details to Shin-chan.

\-00/12/7 (Thursday)

Added Hirano’s revisions into the scriptment. **Pliskin was a sergeant but we made him into a first lieutenant.** First and second lieutenants are rarely together in the field, so will get suggestions from Peter on how to fix that.

We had a rejected song that seems like it would be good for an ending song in Z.O.E., so will use it for the second ending. Also, told them to have a song play in roll 4 from the reunion with Celvice. This way, Muraoka won’t have to do any sound effect work in the latter half.

\-00/12/8 (Friday)

Bought a copy of Robert B. Parker's Early Autumn, a recommendation from Mori. If it's interesting, I'll fish through Parker’s other works. The latest book of the Spenser series was just published. Hayakawa (book store) is having a Parker fair. It made me want to make a paper theater AVD using CG, based on the Spenser series. But I don't think it would sell.

I asked Kume-chan to look into HIDEOKOJIMA.COM. Well, apparently, someone already registered it. What’s more, it was displaying that picture I just took the other day for IGN in front of the Konami JPN entrance\!

\-00/12/11 (Monday)

The long-awaited Plant arc \#3 has been burned, so I checked it out. Although it is a temporary map, the lights are in place to some extent. The normal camera is also in place. The routes of enemy soldiers have not been adjusted yet, but they are in place. 

However...... it’s not good. We have to make major corrections. The helipad and armory in particular need a lot of work. The tight rope area looks workable. Will add in additional gimmicks and revise it.

However, the game offers very limited freedom at this point. It is as initially planned, but compared to the tension of the demolition scene that gave a lot of freedom to go forward, backward, left and right, it’s more like an old-fashioned linear type level. In any case, we can only move forward. I'm worried that people will get bored here. We planned for gameplay flow as we made it, but now that it’s actually put together, it’s different from how I had imagined it. Will see how things go and make adjustments.

What is more frightening is the underwater scene. I smelled the scent of danger as I saw a temporary version starting up at Sonoyama’s station. We need a conclusion at an early stage. The first claymore corridor was hard to see, so lowered it down. The angle from below makes the plant look grander, so will do it that way. The texture of the backside of the plant doesn’t appear to have any problems, so it’s probably fine.

\-00/12/12 (Tuesday)

Made major revisions based on the long-awaited Plant arc \#3. The Nikita missile is proving quite tough. First of all, I don't know where the power panels are. I don't know how the pipes are connected. As a solution, we will paste a map of the pipes (blue) on the wall. Even if you know the location of the pipes, you can't clear it. It’s the same as the VR on maximum difficulty. This makes it impossible for normal players to clear. As a solution, will make it easy to get from the small room with the gun camera. As long as hints are given, it can be cleared without any skill. Will decide on the rest after seeing how many hints are in the polygon cutscenes and radio segments at the beginning. I have thought about removing these kinds of events from the game countless times, but I can agree with the opinions of staff that say, MGS needs these kinds of mean events. I wonder if new players will stick around.

The map in the underwater mode was still not interesting when I played it again. In addition, the background of the map for the fight with Vamp was changed by people on the story and landscape teams “just because.” That’s an important part. The original design, planning, and gameplay must be prioritized, not the appearance of the map. And we need to simulate the boss fight while we make it…..

In the evening, I went to Jingumae studio for a PS2 party. First, I went to the BF2 waiting room and ate bento. The bento here really is good. It motivates me to work together with everyone. However, I didn't have much of an appetite, so I left a lot of it uneaten. The waiting room was almost full of people from Konami. That’s a bit regrettable, since it was supposed to be shared with people from other companies too. 

Inafune happened to walk by and talk to us in the room. He said the master of Onimusha is almost finished. The submission is 2 days from now. Seeing him, I feel jealous. Will I be that bright around this time next year?

The PS2 party started at 6:30 pm. The venue was filled with members of the media. It filled up right away. Interviews were conducted on live camera for each of the titles released in January. A total of 14 titles. MGS2 was the last one up. Of course, this is probably because the release date has not yet been decided. After Onimusha was finished, Inafune told the audience, "I'm going to the Media Works year-end party now” and left. How very courteous of him.

Two and a half hours on my feet, no food, no alcohol...... and almost no interviews. People kept mistakenly asking if I was someone from SCE. When I told them that I wasn’t, they would say, "Oh, so you must be the person in charge of this game then?” and walk away. I guess they want to interview SCE's PR person. A lot of people would ask “are there any famous creators here?” right in front of me.

The party ended before 9pm. Maruyama and Saiki from the promotion team came to greet me.

\-00/12/13 (Wednesday)

Placed shield soldiers in the engine room in the tanker arc. Also made there be 4 attack soldiers. This makes for quite a lot of security. This will be the climax of the tanker arc. This is where we want players to enjoy clearing and the behavior of enemy soldiers. Especially where the AI is different from the previous game.

\-00/12/14 (Thursday)

Continued modifying the scriptment from yesterday since they changed the map of the underwater scene. At Yoshiike's station, the map was modified again to go with the original scriptment plan. The number of breaths will be reduced to two. The location of the thermal goggles will also be changed. An item (Nikita) will be placed in the hidden duct of the Nikita room.

What should be done when an enemy soldier is put to sleep in a disguise event? The problem will be dealt with by increasing the number of enemy soldiers. We’ll also place the bottle and grain programs (gimmicks) in the tanker arc and divert it. The waiting room for enemy soldiers is relatively easy to process, so we can display about 10 enemy soldiers.

Had them display a harrier at the harrier fight bridge. The size was as calculated. I am worried that it’s not as intimidating as the Hind. We also had a seagull fly over to see how the display was processed.

Tried walking around the perimeter and central building of plant \#3. There are some points that need modifications, such as the D leg and CD connecting bridge being thin, but the perimeter scenes look okay from a planning standpoint, including the tightrope. The three-dimensional gimmick of cautiously moving forward and backward in harmony was successful, as was the goal.

Fukushima has started revising the script. The first draft should be coming around next week or so. It had been my own closed creation so far, but now it will be a draft revised from other perspectives. I want to make sure that the core of the work is not blurred like with Hollywood movies.

Got a call from Shin-chan, who is on a business trip to the U.S. The meeting with MacFarlane lasted four hours, but it went well. I was glad to hear that. I have high expectations for this year's figures. I must go to the Toy Show in February even if it is cold.

\-00/12/15 (Friday)

I will try to put a cypher on the CD liaison bridge. The cypher here should be stationary in the air so that users can understand what a cypher (aerial camera) is. They will also learn that the use of a tranquilizer gun to capture the bridge won’t work here. If we use chaff here, the cypher would be powerless. Will abandon the lame concept of the D-leg as a command center and focus on the "large, multi-man enemy deployment" gameplay. Will make it the first challenge after the bomb demolition starts.

It seems that the Z.O.E. team, or rather Konami JPN WEST, is running out of DVDs. I'll ask Kume-chan to ask if EAST, Konami TYO, and Konami STUDIO if they have any in stock.

I bought the second volume of The Stand. Pollock’s new book was also out, so I bought that too. I need to finish reading Early Autumn soon. At this rate, my last book of the 21st century may be Pollock's.

\-00/12/18 (Monday)

Submitted the pre-master of Z.O.E. to SCE. We have until January 15th to debug, and adjust the cutscenes and difficulty level. That’s a relief.

Played the pre-master version to the end. The sound direction still needs work. And, of course, the cutscenes are still to come. The problem is how to impactfully use the effects. I'm still wondering if I should edit the loop cutscene.

Got suggestions from Fukushima on revisions up until the fight with Fat Man. I adopted the parts he revised and deleted and put them in a new folder. I see, when the plot is analyzed objectively, this sort of thing is bound to happen a lot. However, there still haven’t been any ideas like what I was expecting.

I bought John Wetton's new album Welcome to Heaven, which I had long been waiting for. This time, I told the clerk, "John Wetton's ......," and for once, he understood me. The clerk took me to the progressive rock section, where I found the album on the shelf. It even came with a desk calendar…..

5.1 channel equipment (surround sound audio brand) came. Set it up in the seminar room. I tried to watch the Ohama Beach scene from Saving Private Ryan as a test. Although it was not as good as in a movie theater, it was quite immersive. If this could be reproduced in MGS2 as is, it would be amazing. However, doing that in game would be impossible….that’s the problem.  It’s only the cutscene playback where it’s not immersive enough. In Private Ryan, when a soldier gets shot, you can tell by the sound where they were. This is a great thing in the two-dimensional world.

\-00/12/19 (Tuesday)

In the morning, when I opened the front door, the sky was still dark. Part of it may be that it just rained, but winter has truly arrived.

I bought a deluxe edition copy of Midway: History Series by Yukinobu Hoshino. It was the 25th anniversary of his debut as a manga artist. I read the first two stories. The drawings were a bit lacking, but they were good. I heard he special selected them, but his graphic images are excellent. I have already read the stories from the 3rd on, but I will read them again.

When I celebrate the 25th anniversary of my gaming career, it will be the year ......2010-2011. Will I still be making games then?

Thinking about 10 years in the future, it’s not far from now. My son will be 17 years old, which as they report these days, is a difficult age to be. I want to keep working on games until my 25th anniversary\! I suddenly feel that way. I never thought so before. I wonder what's going on?

I wrote a manuscript for the mook book of Avalon. As usual, I found myself writing more than 800 characters. That's easily twice what I needed. I'll take some time to revise and submit it by the end of the week.

I went to the club for the first time in almost two weeks because of a leg injury. It had been a while since I swam, so it felt good.

Played the English version of Z.O.E. The voice actors, who are actually 14 years old, are very fresh. The female voices are pretty close to Viola, Ada, Celvice, and Elena, so it's a double. Norman is better here. But they’re all cartoonish performances. I'm going to start preparing a loop cutscene of Z.O.E., and I'll edit it tentatively tomorrow and finish it at the end of the day. The cutscene near the ending with the beam bending around Atlantis is uncool, so I'll have it removed.

John Wetton's new album is good. His voice, melody, and vocal style are soothing. It's healing for me.

Since yesterday, I have been reading the second volume of Stephen King's The Stand. I have mixed feelings when I think about how it was written 25 years ago. This was King's second novel, but it is very well written. The characterization and plotting are terrific. This is what makes King so interesting. But I can also understand why his original work couldn’t be adapted to film. They have a structure and form that can only be expressed in a novel. MGS is also something that can only be expressed in a game.

\-00/12/20 (Wednesday)

At 10:00 a.m., the new spring graduate hires arrived. 6 designers, 3 programmers, and 2 clerical workers, a total of 11 people. We held interviews in the seminar room. We had chairs lined up facing each other, and went in order for 7 minutes each. An assistant advised us when we were coming up on 7 minutes. Had interviews with every single one. I hope that the female programmers will be able to grow and have a good future in the industry. Had lunch with the new graduates. I talked with them while eating. They were nervous, and didn’t talk much.

After that, we went straight into a production meeting. That used up the whole day.

Received a copy of Mobile Suit Gundam from Bandai. It came from Ushimura, who attended the conference with me at the Tokyo Game Show.

Connected the tanker arc, and burned the first ROM. It still needs work, but I can get a sense of how it feels to play through it. Now we can start fine tuning. So far, the engine room and long corridor have not brought out the impression I had thought they would.

Had 2 of the new graduates play the demo version of MGS2. They beat it in 40-60 minutes each without hints. The difficulty must not be too bad.

\-00/12/21 (Thursday)

Yesterday, after the year-end party, we went to karaoke as usual, and after that a few of us drank until 3:00 AM. It was Scott, Kaneda, Nojiri, and myself. It was closing time before we realized it. They kept flicking the lights off and on to signal us to get out.

I was tired last night, so I went straight to bed. I took a morning bath for the first time in a while. It was cold outside, so I dried my hair with a dryer just in case. I don't want to get sick this time of year.

\-00/12/22 (Friday)

Edited the opening cutscene of Z.O.E.

Bought a copy of Early Autumn. I will probably not be able to finish The Stand by the end of this year, but I’ll need something to read at the start of next year. I will not be able to carry that heavy book home anyway.

I ran late burning a disc for the next part of the tanker arc, so I couldn’t participate in a meeting.

Swam at the club. It was empty today. I noticed that they updated the sauna.

Finished the majority of revisions on Z.O.E., including the cutscenes. We decided on our course. As expected, the cutscenes are hard to use if they aren’t long-takes. The short cuts weren’t working well. Will get it to almost finished by tomorrow.

\-00/12/23 (Saturday)

I went to the office to edit Z.O.E.

When I went to the editing room to edit Z.O.E., it was being backed up. Neither Okamura nor Murata were there. I couldn’t edit anything\!

After making some minor adjustments, the OP is almost done. Will make some final adjustments and finish it this week.

\-00/12/25 (Monday)

They suddenly needed an MGS2 ad for the Z.O.E. DVD used in storefronts, so I edited the footage. Since I know what kind of footage is in MGS2, it was quick to put together and edit.

Did a check of the tanker arc disc. It freezes at the point where you enter the long corridor. All I could do was play up until the engine room. Adding in the engine room makes the tanker map feel more consistent. Also, by using the same map for the course of going up to the bridge, defeating Olga, and then going to the hold, it adds depth to the structure and how you approach it. Adjustments still need to be made, but it is interesting. Will make the engine room more difficult so it becomes a climax to the stage. The clearing will be difficult, so we need to decide what direction to go soon.

The background of the engine room was done by Mogi, and looking at it now, I can see the influences of Negi and Mineshi. I will have it fixed in a comprehensive manner at the end.

\-00/12/26 (Tuesday)

In the news, they announced the gross box-office revenues for the year 2000\.  MI:2 in first place, followed by Pokemon in second place, and among Japanese films, Whiteout was in fifth place, Perfect Storm in eighth place, and End of Days in tenth place. The children's films Doraemon and Toy Story 2 naturally topped the list, and the rest were Hollywood action films. These must be the things people are going out to see. This trend also applies to the music and video game market. This means that games aimed at kids and Hollywood-style games will still be popular. Will these players be receptive to MGS2? It’s an adventurous challenge to the major market.

I played the tanker arc. The crux of the game's balance and the climax really are in the engine room. This is a point in the early game, the point where strength and weakness are created. The ship's hold, which I was worried about, looks bad, as expected. In particular, the route under the floor lacks interest. The key point is how much of a sense of anxiety can be created on the above-ground route. If this route goes well, the rest will just be bonus routes. Dolph's speech needs 5-8 minutes at a minimum. I’ll have them read through all the speech contents.

\-01/1/4 (Thursday)

**The year 2001 has begun. It is the 21st century that I have dreamed of since I was a child. This year, I have to complete MGS2 at any cost. That’s all this year is about. Yes, it is my year. I want to devote myself only to production without thinking about anything else.**

**But back when I was a kid, who would have predicted that the 21st century would be like this? The future I predicted when I was a child was a pipe dream. Wars, conflicts, hunger discrimination, violence, etc. would disappear, and the wisdom and scientific power of mankind would build a healthy society that transcends national borders. ...... This 21st century has gone down an entirely different direction from the world I dreamed of as a kid. Japanese young people, working people, housewives, etc. do not know what is happening in the world. They are not even interested in it. I wonder how long it has been like this? People have no interest in the future, only in the present. Is it a problem of education? Is it the decline of mass media? Is it the influence of the entertainment industry, including video games?  Enjoyment of the present alone will not lead to a better tomorrow.**

**We should do something about this in the 21st century, even if it’s just a little bit. For the sake of our children.**

Muraoka told me that The Stand is not interesting. I'm in the middle of the second volume, so I'm wondering whether I should abandon it or not. Bought Parker's Paper Doll. I will read that one first. I have three books of the Spenser series: Early Autumn, Pastime, and Paper Doll, as well as Family Honor, part of the Sunny Randall series.

I received a script from Fusshi from up to the Arsenal Awakening and revised it. **Made a sweeping change for players who started from the plant arc so that they do not have to go to the tanker arc after rescuing the president. For players who started from the plant arc, it will be added after the ending as a bonus. This is one of the biggest changes to be made recently. The game flow will be better. Otherwise the tempo becomes bad when the player switches to Snake.**

Played the near-final version of Z.O.E. through to the end. The cutscene part has not changed much.

I received a New Year's card from Director Ishii. I'm so happy\! I'm going to treasure it.

When I came home and turned on the TV, I found a science special that was a trailer for "NHK Special: Space," which will start in the spring. I called my family and told my son about it. It seemed he had just gotten out of the bath.

After that, for some reason, I got caught up watching Contact and ended up watching it all the way through. I had seen this movie in a theater before, but it was still interesting. There is just something that pulls you in. It's not that it entertains as a film, but must be a longing for the universe. Maybe I was interested in Jodie Foster's lines and the characters' ideas about space ...... and wanted to check them out again.

\-01/1/5 (Friday)

Had McDonalds breakfast in front of my computer for the first time in years.  It was nice to have warm food. I looked at my e-mails while chewing.  It's nice to do this sometimes. I seem to have a self-deprecating nature (a kind of narcissism). Eating junk food always reminds me of my boarding house days. Every day was interesting back then.

\-01/1/10 (Wednesday)

I’m going to Nasu tonight, so I left home with my suit and 2 days’ worth of supplies in my suitcase. It's nice to wear a suit once in a while.

I printed out a tentative script for dubbing. It’s 180 pages. The second half will be 300 pages long. Will it really be finished? Can we release it this year? Should we cut off the second half (split it)?

**I can't get the worst-case scenario out of my head. I could hardly sleep last night. I'm going to have a hard time in this condition. I have only nightmares. They are not direct dreams, like "a big bug appears during development," or "development is delayed and a master cannot be put out”. They are dreams of all manner of evil spirits attacking me. Beings of the most disgusting and frightening shapes and colors, beyond what I can put into words, and most of them chasing me.  I dream of things like my teeth being torn to shreds. Every night, several times, I wake up feeling so uncomfortable. It makes me hate going to sleep. I felt chills even while I was dreaming.**

\-01/1/15 (Monday)

The release date was decided at the meeting in Nasu. The Japanese version’s deadline is too strict (near impossible?) and the English and European editions are tough too. Scott has returned so we're going to discuss and re-evaluate our plans. Since the endpoint is set in stone, we are limited in what we can do.

During lunch and break time, the MGS2 schedule suddenly weighed heavily on me. I tried to shrug it off.

**I have no appetite.** I know I need to eat, but there is nothing I can do about it. I managed to swallow down what I could.

Watch Beyan's (Not sure who this is) water surface processing. As expected, the waves are lighter than those of a storm. Texture effects do appear when moving the camera up and down, but it doesn’t work at high angles. If we don’t balance the camera well and play tricks with the textures, it will give away that it isn’t reflective. However, this processing can be used for the surface of swimming poos. But as a result of adding in the D-legs and being able to get a very close-up view in 1st person, we’ll need to make the polygons even more detailed.

Checked the last part where Fusshi had made some changes. It’s been reduced by a quarter. However, the part where Fortune tries to act on her own…….seems odd for the character. What should we do? Will check the whole scriptment again. Will start on line revisions tomorrow.

**This was how we did things last time. It’s what Cameron did with T2. First, I write the scriptment until the end. Then, I give it to another person (Fukushima), who can look at it objectively. He revises the script from his own point of view. Not the game design part, but the scriptment part in particular.**

**I then revise the scriptment again after it has been objectively viewed and returned. I consider how other people would perceive it. Then I return the corrected version to Fusshi again. In this way, we continue to play catch with each other. Whether this method is good or bad, it is a common practice in Hollywood. It’s a good method when short on time. However, there are drawbacks. The characters' speaking styles and personalities change from scene to scene. Also, the various individual writer’s personalities are lost, and things are flattened.**

It worked well with Policenauts and Snatcher. From now on, I have to either do only the planning and leave the rest to others, or close the entire production process by myself like in the past. If I don’t pick one or the other I’ll be overwhelmed with stress.

I ask my assistant for the reception room, but it seems that it’s booked up with appointments this week. I can't get work done in my usual seat. Is there any place I can seclude myself?

**And whether or not to cut the sword and Snake support specs? I still can't decide. I'd like to do the Snake stuff, but the sword would be iffy gameplay-wise. There are risks there.**

Shin-chan sent me the final settings for Fat Man. I thought about it carefully and realized that the high abdomen of the bomb-blast suit makes it impossible to see half his face, which means there is no need for lip-synching. This is good\! I was pleased, but it means he can’t drink during the scene where they drink wine, so I changed it to a cocktail glass and had him drink it with a straw. But still, he has a scary face. He must have blown up bombs more than once. His face is a 180-degree shift from what I envisioned, but I gave it the OK. Normally, a man with such a face is not suited for nerve-racking work. He looks like a professional wrestler.

\-01/1/16 (Tuesday)

I couldn’t use the reception room for language checks, so I worked on the scriptment at my seat.

**Added the shaver as an item. This is a rare item that can be obtained by putting Emma to sleep and shaking her. If you have it, Raiden's armpit hair will disappear. I wonder who will be happy about that?**

**The Kanekichi soldier was born. He’s a soldier who comes up to the observation deck from the tanker deck after the battle with Olga. After a certain amount of time, he dives off the railing and disappears. Kanekichi's name is on his prestigious dog tag. One of the rare IDs. Also later in the game, will make it so Snake is also put to sleep so that you can take his dog tag. The problem is what name to give Snake's dog tag. Having it be the player’s name might be tough.**

I gave Okaji and Shibata some ideas for underwater effects. I'm hoping to create a sense of being underwater and floating without underwater fog. How far can we go with bubbles and floating garbage? The key is the refraction of light. How can we make it more attractive by having lights placed on the wall? I want to aim to create something unlike underwater effects in past games. Worst case scenario, we would have to add a raster-like effect. I don't want to do that. Most of the underwater effects in games are like this. In actuality, you don't see that kind of shimmering underwater. The light from the top is just refracted and only the light bends. If this could be done, it would be an effect that would go down in history.

A new world that seems to follow droplets of rain. A floating commodity is the last resort. I will give Okaji the edited videos of reference underwater footage such as Flood, Alien 4, Deep Blue Sea, Deep Rising, and others, as well as the original videos. I suggested that we buy a fish tank, but postponed the idea because I don’t want the room to be flooded.

I watched the placeholder poly-cutscene of the tanker sinking. It's long. But Ocelot, Colonel, and Snake seem to be enjoying themselves. They look lively. It’s the tension you’d expect from MGS. Will show the video at E3.

Placed one Marine on the upper route of the hold. You can get a dog tag from this Marine using a hold up. Also, placed Ocelot (his boots) at the foot of RAY at the end of the lower route so that you can photograph him. You cannot attack.

\-01/1/17 (Wednesday)

Six years have passed today since the Great Hanshin Earthquake. I couldn’t believe it had been six years already, but at the same time when I see news about the current situation in Kobe, which has not yet fully recovered, I feel pain in my chest. My son is 7 years old, but he was less than 2 years old at that time. Time flies by too quickly, yet human pain alleviates far too slowly.

Finished reading A Catskill Eagle from the Spencer series. The plot is so irresponsible that I am indeed overwhelmed. I have been reading six of Parker's novels in a row since the end of the year, but I will stop for a while. Read Pollock's new book, which I had purchased at the end of the year. I found several books of the Spenser series at Ueno's seat. I was annoyed that he read them before me. I feel strangely jealous.

I borrowed the reception room and stayed there for a while. I have to finish revising the scriptment by tomorrow. I keep messing with the game parts. But in the reception room, I can concentrate. I managed to finish the revisions and put them into the database.

I went swimming at the club for the first time in almost a month. I'm worried about the effects in the underwater scenes. Raster looks strange underwater. It only appears to shake like that just under the water’s surface. When the camera is underwater, light penetrates from above the surface. That light is refracted on the surface of the water. This shimmering element must be sampled well. The idea for the rain droplets came to me by chance when Oshii showed me how they did the digital remixing for the DVD of Patlabor: The Movie. I am not sure if my memory is correct, but I think it was how it was expressed in the rain scene at the port. Instead of drawing the lines of the rain directly on the celluloid, he used a special effects brush to deform only the droplets that bounced off the character's shoulders. Who knew this kind of representation was even possible? I was impressed that there is a way to make something visible without showing it intentionally. If it were Disney, they would have spent a lot of time and money to draw every drop of water that trickled down the body.

The feel of the underwater controls is just one more step from being ready. Something is missing. I would like to see a specification that allows the camera to move forward in a fun way and to change the distance of the camera depending on speed. But what is missing that would provide that?

**Will name the interior parts of the arsenal as stomach, rectum, etc. Use pronunciations somewhere close to deck names, such as ascending colon or transverse colon. I was going to use uterus or vagina, but ethics complicate things. I also met opposition from the childish staff. I decided against it.**

**It is the same as Pinocchio who was swallowed by the whale. However, Raiden is swallowed by a giant mass of information and is digested from the rear, rather than from the mouth.**

Raiden will be entirely naked. **Will put a tattoo on his butt.**

\-01/1/18 (Thursday)

Purchased a commuter pass in the morning. The automatic commuter pass machine was newer than last time. You can also buy new passes now. Previously, new customers had to go to the ticket counter.

When I inserted my old commuter pass, the new commuter pass displayed in large size on the monitor. The large letters are designed so that even people with poor eyesight and the elderly can see the new pass. It has become very convenient. The node terminal should do the same.

My new commuter pass is valid until April 18\. Whenever I buy a pass, I look at the date and think about when it will expire and where the development of MGS2 will be at that time. By April, it should be moving along quite well, and at an accelerated pace. The recording and the drama parts will be done. What about the bosses? The motion capture will……. etc., etc. Every day, end up confirming those details as I ride the train. Every day, it adds to my stress and pressure.

Had a meeting with Asatsu and Konami JPN. Asked Okamura for materials for Z.O.E.

**Raiden's clothes are on fire during the battle with Fortune. I came up with the idea of seeing that. Raiden's long hair, which he is proud of, is also on fire, and if he leaves it alone, his head becomes bald. After that, he proceeds completely bald, even in cutscenes. However, various "wigs" can be prepared with items. Naturally, there are some with Raiden's hair style. There is also the "Bakatono" wig. When wearing this wig, it will fall off whenever the player performs actions such as flips and somersaults. When the wig falls to the floor, it becomes an item box again on the spot. The good-looking protagonist ends up bald from the first boss battle. Incredibly funny. It can even translate into the poly cutscenes. However, it met with opposition from the staff. I guess it’s a no-go?**

**The torture room in the Arsenal. Just like in the last game, will place a cardboard box next to a naked Raiden. Veteran players will think they can get their equipment back and retrieve the box. Raiden gets dressed in the shadows of the torture room. When he finishes changing and comes out, he is completely naked and has the cardboard box around his waist....as a joke. This is also funny, but it will take a lot of work, so I put it on hold.**

I had them place Ocelot in the third hold, but they couldn't find a good position for him. Since it is not possible to give him animations, we will need to consider it. We will try to find a position where that works using only current animations. I don't know how many people will be able to find this specification on their own. MGS2 is ultimately a game.

Page 146:

**Changed Raiden's blood from white to red. I was thinking of linking him to Redwood in Policenauts, but decided against it. The sprites are additive, so the white color would shine, especially underwater. Currently, red blood is displaying a lot better, so I'll go with red. Removed the milk blood plot from the story as well. Instead, I will come up with a way to make Emma bleed (underwater) from her crotch. Will add a sequence where Raiden, who can't stand to watch, asks, "Emma, where are you hurt?”, and she blushes and says "I'm fine". Then there is the scene where Emma dies after being stabbed by Vamp. When Raiden is concerned about the amount of blood she is losing, she says, "I'm fine, it’s just my period” and Emma quietly breathes her last. When I told the staff, I got nearly 100% disapproval.**

\-01/1/19 (Friday)

There was an article in the paper about people working in skyscrapers. I read the article and decided to add a plot on how Raiden and Rose met. Will embed it in the radio first thing in the morning. It’s a romantic and nerdy plot. It would be suitable for MGS2. Snake is Godzilla and Raiden is King Kong, so it's perfect.

If Raiden's animation is kept as it is, it will be too much. The reason is that there are many weapons. It may not fit in the resident domain. We must use shared animations as much as possible.

\-01/1/22 (Monday)

The morning horoscope introduced Virgo as the best day. I don't believe in horoscopes, but a good one makes me feel good.

At noon, I bought a copy of Parker's Wilderness. I’ll read it once I finish The Godwulf Manuscript, which I am reading now. Parker’s work is just right for me right now.

At 10:30 a.m., I had a meeting for the Z.O.E. special.

Mori came to the office at 2:00 p.m. I had an interview to do, so I only had time for a greeting.

\-01/1/23 (Tuesday)

I dropped my gloves when getting off of the train in the morning. I couldn't afford to lose them, since they were a Christmas gift from my wife. I noticed after getting out of the car, and when I went to go back to the train, a woman I didn’t know had picked them up. I was so happy. Tokyo is not irredeemable yet. There are some decent people out there. Boys who want to kill people, young parents who abuse their children...

Read the first half of the MGS2 book, with background music. I liked Scott's Colonel and Nishiki’s Rose. I played Snake. There weren’t any scenes where I got to yell yet, so I was dissatisfied.

I decided to use the same sprite expression as explosions instead of primitives for muddy water. I will use the stealth application that Okaji made elsewhere. At Takabe’s station, there were tentative screens for night vision and infrared goggles. If noise is added, it should be viewable. The current effects are realistic, but they hurt my eyes after long periods of time, so I will have them reduced to be easier on the eyes.

Tentative sound was taken to create a cutscene of the VR scene. Makimura was Snake and Yoshiike was Raiden. The recording microphone is good, and the amplifier and speakers in the editing room are good, so it doesn't sound too strange. We should be able to use it for longer VR footage. I think I’m going to insert some experimental footage from when the PS2 graphics board arrived. When I unearthed the example material, it was Hi8 material. I wonder what players will think when they see this.

\-01/1/24 (Wednesday)

Inafune sent me a copy of Onimusha. I played it right away. In the opening scene, Otsuka did the voice of Nobunaga.

I had already played the demo version, but it was a pain to replay those parts I had already played. I have to leave a gap between the trial version and the main game. This is why we have to be careful about the timing of the trial version. I wish there was a good way to handle it. I think that new players of MGS2 will be introduced from the plant arc, so they won't have this problem. They’ll arrive at a new development scene.

I played through the disc of the tanker arc. As planned, the game has a good structure and tension. I gave instructions to make minor corrections to the camera, enemy placement, item placement, etc. There is not enough tension in the long corridor and the hold is too tough. The ship's hold, in particular, needs to be made much less difficult.

Since Matsuhana is off, the video editing will be done tomorrow.

On an American website, I found a casting list titled "If MGS were to be made into a movie, who would the actors be?” The casting is quite good. Snake is Russell Crowe. Famke Janssen as Wolf is the best casting. She has been getting a lot of attention since Deep Rising. Personally I would want her to be Naomi.

I spent the whole afternoon at a meeting for a commercial (CI) for Konami JPN. I couldn't get any work done today either. Please forgive me for that. I was going to add an episode about Rose and Raiden, but I haven't been able to work on it yet.

The staff had gathered to discuss about the Fortune boss fight at Morita’s station. I held back and watched from the sidelines. If I butt in at this point, I cannot expect them to grow. But if it doesn't turn out good, it's a waste of time. I look forward to seeing how well they reproduce the specifications and scriptment. As usual, if I interfere at this stage, they will not make progress. I will be patient until the rough draft is completed.

\-01/1/25 (Thursday)

**I have been having a mental breakdown recently. Well, I’m the one saying that, so maybe it's not that bad. The pressure of the MGS2 upload, the built-up stress, and the lack of concern in the staff...... it’s gotten hard to deal with.** I have no way to release stress. I listen to music to keep my sanity, 80's new wave. Today I'm listening to Visage. I don't remember having such a good time back then. Still, for some reason, it reminds me of my youth and gives me energy. That's all.

Edited video material for a TV commercial.

Revised the second half of the scriptment. A lot of Emma's poly cutscenes were moved to the radio. This will increase the amount of radio and Shinkawa theater.

The right joy stick blade is moving more or less. It does not yet have a pleasant feeling or flashy movement, but I have a feeling that it could be good. Will have them adjust the animation and timing of the pause before the action to be more compatible with the analog stick. Also, switched it to a thrust when held down, and a slice when punched. The big move button should be a defense button. We have not yet reached a conclusion as to whether or not we will joy stick cycling. However, while enemy soldiers can be taken down, I think it will be impossible to use swords against each other in boss battles gameplay-wise. **Let's make it blade vs. Snake hand.**

\-01/1/29 (Monday)

**I have not been feeling well since this morning. I have a headache and nausea. My stomach feels heavy. When I stand up to go to the bathroom, I feel faint.**

In the evening, I left the office and went to the bookstore. I bought a copy of Spenser's Promised Land.

Rui Naito from PR came in for an interview. I told him about the live-action filming. He was very enthusiastic about the idea, and if we can shoot Federal Hall, Times Square, the Star-Spangled Banner, etc. in New York by ourselves and use them, it will be cheaper, even after deducting the cost of travel. With this, I think we will be able to do the second half of the New York City footage. I really wish I could go with them, but with my schedule, I don't think I will be able to. Too bad. I am a little worried, but I am sure he will be fine. I am sure he will be able to capture the images that I intended.

\-01/1/30 (Tuesday)

Neither Matsuhana nor Muraoka were here today, so I concentrated on the scriptment. I tweaked the distribution of the poly cutscenes and the radio cutscenes and put them back together again. The temporary script we’re submitting to KME was less than 200 pages when Fusshi looked over it. Maybe I cut too much?

Inserted a fight with the Tengu commandos before the Arsenal encounter with Fortune. Applied Olga's animation to the Tengu commandos turned out to be a surprisingly good fit. It is genuinely cool. The only battle currently is in hallway B, so we concluded that it was a waste of space.

If we end up making a background for a huge circular elevator, then we will use it. Upon arriving at the center of the circular elevator, the Tengu commandos will descend from the vents on the left and right. In order to make players use the sword here, no additional ammunition should be generated. Here, they can use ammunition to their heart's content, or let them play with the sword and slay about 100 or 200 people.

Swam at the club. My legs hurt from shoveling snow, so I stopped after 5 laps.

I applied for a copy of L’arc-en-Ciel’s new single.

\-01/1/31 (Wednesday)

**I have no choice but to scrap the decoy balloons. It's painful, but no matter how I think about it, I can't make it in time.** Today is the end of January. I thought about the details of the game even while I was on the train. Especially before going to bed, I remember a lot of things. It’s hard to fall asleep.

Considered adding more people, but decided not to because it would confuse the team. Also, most of the people in charge of boss enemies are not experienced. I feel uneasy. We have to evaluate them early on. In any case, the story team is the key.

\-01/2/1 (Thursday)

As of today, it’s February. I'm going to judge some work at the Konami School. The location is the Shibuya School. I hope they have good people.

In the evening, I returned to Ebisu to check the disk of the tanker arc. The disk is already full. The stage data hasn't been compressed yet, but whether or not the poly cutscenes will fit is in jeopardy. Knowing that, if we cancel the cutscenes, the play time is 30 minutes to an hour at the least.

\-01/2/2 (Friday)

**Fusshi brought revisions on the President's rescue.** Hmm, it has a lot of his writing style in it. It must be boring for the users. Well, it's just that my style has been changed to his. The Hollywood method doesn't work well.

\-01/2/5 (Monday)

Had a discussion with Nojiri about the specifications of the ship’s hold digital camera. It is impossible to do things as he envisioned because of the memory capacity. The number of images that will fit in the memory is 8 at most. ...... We decided to check and judge only the area around RAY (the composition in which RAY is reflected) in the third ship's hold.

Emma's hand-holding event, feels workable. Depending on how far we can go with Emma’s arm using IK, it could be something very complex for a game.

Experimentation with the sword continues. Will have a vertical slash and a horizontal slash added. The thrust was simpler than I had expected. It looks very promising. It could give off a feeling of swordplay that is not found in other games.

Shindo from KME contacted us. He said that due to a conflict with Kenyu Horiuchi's schedule, he could not make it until mid-February. It would be difficult to cast another voice actor for Raiden. In the end, we’ll just have to record the first half between the end of February and March. If possible, we will record the second half as well. Maybe we can push back the motion capture?

McFarlane sent us a PICT of the prototype of the action figures for MGS2.

\-01/2/6 (Tuesday)

**Watched the tentative edits of the commercials. The “Cowboy” version, which was uninteresting even on site, is a waste of time, so we decided to drop it. The "Couples of Today" and "Junior High School Students" versions are quite good, with well-defined characters.**

Will show a special Z.O.E. program on February 12th. The program structure and execution are good. That director is a real talent. I will give him my thanks soon. It is not an ordinary skill to make it to this point in that amount of time. My regret is that the conclusion of the program was not quite coherent. Mistakes like spelling Yoji Shinkawa’s name wrong and saying that “Okamura made 'Tokimeki'" put me at a loss.

A (tentative) naked Raiden was at Johnny's station. The impact was tremendous. Even though he is still a skull suit model with just a skin-colored texture\! It gave me a fighting spirit. This material is good\! Checked out RAY Hanger 1 at Yamashita's station. Since the naked Raiden looks good, I'm going to design the upper and lower courses more leniently so you can proceed through either without raising the difficulty level too much.

I came up with an idea for one last element for the Tanker poster series. I will give it to Kanekichi so that no one else will know. If this works, it will add another element to the 3-D poster. The question is who will play the other guy. If no one is willing to play the role, I will have to be the subject of the poster.

Made it so you can change clothes even after the Gurlukovich disguise event. Of course, you won’t get the benefit of being in disguise, but just the change in appearance will be fun. Also, the poly cutscenes will still be supported. Whether it is possible or not depends on the memory.

Temporary Gurlukovich soldier with Raiden's hair. He looks like a kappa. Kappa Raiden ...... has an impact.

Changed the long dialogue with Olga in the cell from poly cutscene to internal communication. Now there will be even more radio segments.

Left Ebisu at 5:30 PM. The rain was terrible, so I took a cab from America-Bashi. There was so much traffic that it didn’t move at all. The driver didn't know where the studio was, and by the time he got in the vicinity of the map in Shinagawa, an hour had passed. If I knew this would be the case, I would have taken the train. Cabs in Tokyo are a lot like those in New York. Why don't they know the way?

Edited commercials with inferno. Or rather, through an operator who uses "inferno." I added Leo's update to Z.O.E. and modified the last screen of MGS2 to a pull. I think it's not so bad. Finished about 8:00 PM., earlier than planned.

Anomalous activity is occurring on Mt. Fuji. High frequency microtremors are apparently occurring frequently. It was reported on the morning news. Could there be a major eruption?

In the morning, had a meeting to discuss the Harrier fight. I asked them to draw up basic guidelines by the end of February, and we will take it up from there. Priority is given to the appearance rather than the gameplay. Will work until May on improving the effect quality. The gameplay is not too difficult. Effects are handled separately, so managing the processing is a problem.

Looked at the sample images of the ship worms. Although only 4,000 polygon models were placed on the screen, they were more unpleasant than I imagined. At this rate, it will be as good as the concept. I wonder how much of the final effect will come out when the shipworms are moving. I am looking forward to seeing it. It seems that we won’t be able to show 4000\. The plan to cover the whole floor is already not going to happen. All of our original plans and specifications based on that number are gone.

A link to the BBS of Z.O.E. was posted on the CS of the Konami HP. There were twice as many posts as usual, but still not enough.

The setup with naked Raiden was added in. When you are in front of the torture device again, you can raise your hands and pretend that you are being caught. In this case, his crotch, which should not be visible, is hidden by the an open can above the window frame.

Okaji’s muddy stream looks good\! If this is the case, I should have included the muddy stream event as originally planned. Is there any scene we could manage to include? I tried to put it in the computer room, but it was too difficult both story-wise and program-wise (map shape), so I gave up. Too bad\! However, game-wise, it is the same as the big ball in "Crash." It is very simple and not so fresh. This is the gimmick that we wanted to do the most since we decided to set the game in the ocean. Well, the game has to be the priority.

I am not feeling so well after last night's drinking party. **Severe diarrhea,** abdominal pain. Only slept for two and a half hours .......

I'm getting old.

My Mac started to act up in the morning. Memory corruption.

Read The Truth About Shadow Moses. Objectively speaking, the previous one is more interesting as a story. I can't do all the game design, scenarios, maps, direction, editing, promotion, and coordination of 70 people for MGS2 while also doing management and production for other lines. I'd really like to do it all myself, like in the old days. The poly cutscenes are the best part. It's hard not being involved with them this time. I can’t help but be jealous.

Swam at the club, OMD's "Enola Gay" was playing. Then Depeche Mode...... must have been an 80s electro pop station. I feel like I'm surviving on nostalgia for the past these days.

My stomach is feeling bad, probably due to last night's drinking party. Recently, if I go out drinking, I feel terrible the next day. **Something's definitely wrong with my internal organs.**

I put a hard disk on the test machine. Installed all the maps from MGS2. It took about 20 minutes, but it's pleasant\! If it's this fast, it will affect the game design. Users can't take a break either.

MGS2’s presentation at the Toy Show in New York was featured in IGN. Raiden, Fortune, and Solidus were silhouettes, as promised. They seem to think Raiden is a ninja, just as intended. Nice\!

I met Muranaka. It's been half a year. He seems to be in good health. I played the first demo version and showed it to him.

We had a meeting about the RAY fight, and I heard that the walking of RAY is enough since we have IK. Is that really true?

This morning, I noticed that my right foot had stepped on poop at a railroad crossing. It must have been dog shit? This is not a slum, so no way it was human shit left on the railroad tracks. Did I step in it last night? No, I took a cab, so that’s unlikely. Did I step on a land mine on what is commonly known as Poop Street? I haven’t stepped on poop in 10 years\! I was quite discouraged. My mood has soured. Back when I was a kid, before sports day, I was told by my mother, "Go step on horse shit. It will make your legs faster.” Naturally, there was no horse shit around, so I had to go with dog shit, but I remember picking a dry one. In those days, there was a lot of rain-soaked shit around. It lost its color and looked like barium shit.

\-01/3/1 (Wednesday)

It's the release day of Z.O.E. At the same time, it is also the day of the unveiling of MGS2.

In the afternoon, I got a report from the reconnaissance team. It seems that it was flying off the shelves in Shinjuku. That’s a relief.

**A call came in from overseas. It seems Mark Hamill really came to the audition. His performance was outstanding. I want to hear the audition tape before making a decision.**

I will record the poly cutscenes of the previous game and edit them. I applied the pictures along with the matching lines of dialogue, but it was a low-poly video. Even though the video is from a 3-year-old game, it makes me lose motivation. It doesn't get any better.

A VHS of live-action footage arrived from IMAGICA. The Millennium Countdown scene and the office footage are usable.

Internet ranking started at 6:00 PM. We all set up the camera and counted down. We heard the time report that “it is now 6:00 PM”, but nothing happened. Maybe that’s to be expected.

After a light dinner, the first report came. About 80 people have entered. Some of them are from the UK and Sweden.

I have skipped my diary for a week again. It is difficult to keep writing when I get busy. This is especially true when I have to go out or have a lot of meetings, and interviews. I doubt if I can continue from now on.

I'm going to the head office today, so I'm wearing a suit. I really hate suits.

\-01/9/11 (Tuesday)

Two typhoons are approaching, and typhoon No. 15 is already close. But so far, the rain and wind have not been too bad. Trains are running normally. I have been working more than 20 hours a day, without a break.

At this time of year, people are divided into two types. There are those who try to escape from the hardships of development. They suddenly say, "I need to… , I want to go to….. " or "I've had enough of development, I want it to be over.” The other type is the people who only think about the project saying "I don't have enough time, if only I had more time.” The former is not suited for creating things.

**My health has been terrible recently. My stomach and intestines are at their worst. And on top of all of that, I have a severe headache today.** I bought a bottle of arrowroot solution at the pharmacy, but it didn't take away the pain.

While checking the game, I thought about the composition of the TGS video. I think it would be better not to include Raiden. I've been having people play on the monitor for a few days, and the surprise around the switch from Snake to Raiden seems to be high. It would probably be wise to use this as a catalyst. Expose Raiden in commercials and promotions for an explosive American release.  No doubt it will be a surprise to everyone. This isn’t a TV series, the sequel needs to surprise the audience.

Integrated Kyle's OP into the game. It was just in time.

At night, an incident happened.

It took away many lives and our dreams.

\-01/10/19 (Friday)

The production is scheduled to finish today. I can't be happy about it because the situation is not normal with the terrorist attacks in the U.S. and anthrax, but at least it's a break. What will happen to the world in the future? I am still anxious, but for the first time in three years, my busyness in the midst of anxiety will be relieved. I want to relax for the first time in a while. However, once the master is finished, I will not be able to relax until December with all the presentations, interviews, preparation for the launch, and promotions. But this time, I am really tired.

I'm exhausted.

I finished reading  Sci-Fi Moon by Umehara. It's interesting. It would be cool if Carventer made a movie out of it. It's not likely to be a hit, but I like this kind of world, but since it’s 80’s sci-fi, probably only people in their 30’s and up would enjoy it.

\-01/11/27 (Tuesday)

In the afternoon, I went to the doctor for a diagnosis. Unfortunately, it seems that I'm already like “the boy who cried wolf”, and they don't take me seriously, given my history. It may really just be stress again. Looking at the results of a one-day physical checkup I had at the end of July, they said the painful part of my back might be a tumor. For the stomachache, they gave me a week's supply of Gastar and Selbex.

**They are going to take blood samples and run some tests just in case. The results are expected on Monday. I gave the doctor a copy of MGS2.**

He said that if the pain is in my pancreas, I can't drink alcohol. I am not familiar with the term pancreas. The name sounds like it is an important organ. Either way, I won't be relieved if I don't know the cause.

However, the pain in my stomach does not go away even after taking the medicine I was given. It seems as if it starts to hurt whenever my stomach is empty. If that happens, this medicine should help by suppressing stomach acid.

Anyway, it hurts. I can't concentrate.

In the afternoon, I bought a book of essays (interviews) by Yuichi Shimpo.

I signed the greeting cards for the limited editions of the game, which will be sent to Carpenter, Bryan Singer, Stephen Norrington, and others. I am somewhat happy. I was going to write some comments, but my English is rough, so I decided not to.

\-01/11/29 (Wednesday)

At last, today is the Japanese release date of MGS2. I heard that people are already lining up at large stores despite the cold weather. Thank you for your hard work everyone. Most of the staff members have also gone to check the sales situation, so it is very quiet in the office, almost like it was a holiday.

I've been taking the medicine the doctor gave me, but it doesn't seem to be getting any better. Not only that, the pain is increasing. The pain is especially painful around my stomach. It must be my stomach or duodenum?

\-01/12/28 (Friday)

It is the last day of work for this year, 2001\. The MGS2 team is all on leave except for Takabe. I had planned to prepare a proposal for the next project sometime this year, but I couldn't do it because I had been checking the developer's diary for the making-of book since yesterday. We went through and checked it and cut out the names of individuals, stores, and other risky parts. I'm about halfway done, but it's interesting to read through.

A few minutes ago, a soldier who was on the Kitty Hawk and a foreign newscaster (who speaks Japanese), came to the reception of Konami JPN. They were the ones who had called me yesterday. I signed their copies of MGS2. They gave me a Kitty Hawk cap in return. They said they had been in Afghanistan just a few days ago. They are going to sail again in the new year. They haven’t played MGS yet.

**The year of the snake is almost over.** I don't feel refreshed. My body is still not back to normal.
