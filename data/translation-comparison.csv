It seems that with the upcoming next-generation hardware, full polygons will still be tough to handle. If we aim for film-quality visuals on the Dreamcast or PS2, it’s probably best to avoid full polygons. In the end, even with increased polygon counts on models that previously ran on PCs, the result only gives a slightly better impression. There’s a limit to focusing on details. We need to grasp the essence of how things appear. After seeing today’s Dreamcast software, I got a clear sense of the direction for MGS2. It’s not about the quality of the visuals. It’s about the game itself. The focus will be on gameplay and elements that couldn’t be achieved before, even if that means using low-polygon models. For example, leaving enemy soldiers' corpses on the ground or having 100 enemy soldiers, and so on.","-98/10/6 (Tuesday) I went to SEGA’s “New Challenge Conference 2”. It seems like this next generation of consoles will be tough for full polygon. If you’re looking for cinematic visual quality on the DC or PS2, seems like it’s best to avoid full polygon. Ultimately, the impression I got was that for games on PC, the number of polygons has increased to make thinks look a bit prettier, but there are still limits to how detailed things can get. You need to get to the essence of how things are going to look. Looking at these DC games today, I saw the direction of MGS2. It won’t be cinematic quality. It’s a game at the end of the day, one that prioritizes gameplay and elements that weren’t possible before. Even if that means being low polygon. Like having dead enemies remain, even 100 of them……","","",""

I didn’t have the stamina to stand for a 3-hour movie, so I looked up, and just then, the sign for the theater across the street caught my eye. Austin Powers...

Since we had a morning meeting, we didn’t leave until after 10 a.m. We were guided to the capture studio, Sakuratei. It’s been two years since I last visited IMAGICA. The last time was when we edited a video for TGS right after I moved to Tokyo, working late into the night with the agency staff. By the time I arrived, the setup was already complete. Under Toyopi’s direction, we began capturing. First up was Mei Ling. Mizpin’s model of Mei Ling (without textures) moved in real-time, perfectly synced with the actor’s movements. From a distance, it looked incredibly lifelike. This time, we used magnetic capture. Since the actions were small, we recorded in the smallest studio. The actor was a beautiful actress who had even played a child role in Silent Hill. We added direction to each shot, though it was my first time guiding an actor’s performance, so I was figuring things out as I went. Despite that, we’ve come a long way since the experiment we did at the research lab three years ago. The workflow is much smoother now. It’s clear that handling everything in-house is impossible. We need to prioritize efficiency. At noon, I returned to Ebisu, then went back to IMAGICA at 5 p.m. Toyopi was much more relaxed, likely due to his experience. We finished capturing all the planned shots, and with 30 minutes left, we decided to do some improvisation. The actress performed Dojo Sukui, which she had learned through traditional Japanese dance, using Naomi’s file—it was fascinating to watch. Afterward, I greeted the actress when she removed the data suit and helmet. She was a beautiful and lovely person. I wonder if this kind of profession will become more common in the future.","-98/10/29 (Thursday) Did motion capture at IMAGICA. We had a morning meeting, so left some time after 10. I was guided around Otei capture studio. It’s been 2 years since I’ve been to IMAGICA. I went when I had just arrived in Tokyo to do some video editing for TGS. I worked with the staff there through the dead of night. Set up was already finished by the time I arrived. Toyopi (So Toyota) was front and center handling the captures. We started with Mei Ling. A (texture-less) model of Mei Ling made by Mizupin (Probably Takashi Mizutani) moved in real time matching the actress’ movements. From a distance, it looks quite realistic. A magnetic motion capture system was used. There was limited action this time, so we recorded in a small studio. The actress was quite a looker. She had also done work as the kids in Silent Hill. Actions were done 1 per shooting. It was the first time she was directed for each of the actions, so things proceeded with some fumbling around. Even so, the progress was beyond comparison to what we had tested out 3 years earlier. The programming was good too. I guess it really is impossible to do everything ourselves. We need to think efficiently. We headed back to Ebisu for a bit in the afternoon before going to IMAGICA again at 5. Toyopi was well familiarized with everything and was relaxed. We had captured all the shootings we had expected to, so did adlib recording for the remaining 30 minutes. The traditional dancing the actress had learned and the dojou sukui done using Naomi’s file were quite the sight. We greeted the actress once she’d taken off her motion capture suit and helmet. She was a pretty and cool person. These kinds of jobs may increase in the future.","IMAGICA: A prominent Japanese post-production company.

I connected it to the Game Boy and started playing, and wow, it’s really fun. This is the essence of gaming. The colors are limited to four and a bit hard to see, but even so, it’s more than enough. At 2:00 p.m., I left Ebisu with Muraoka-san and the sound team. We arrived at Pantheon around 2:15 p.m. The line for the Tokyo Fantasia Film Festival extended from the 1st to the 5th floor. One of our sound team members had asked a stranger (wearing an ""Escape from L.A."" hat) to hold a spot before he came to the office, so we managed to secure a good position around the 2nd floor. As a thank-you, we gave the guy a Metal Gear hat. Since there were still more than four hours to wait, Muraoka-san and I went to Tower Records and a bookstore. I bought the ""Dark City"" soundtrack CD and a sniper novel. We rejoined the line, but waiting like this at my age is pretty tough. Coincidentally, the guy with the L.A. hat had a friend who worked at Konami. That friend brought his girlfriend along. Now our group had five people. As the start time approached, more TV cameras appeared. The L.A. guy got caught by a camera and was interviewed. At the last minute, in a moment of madness, he shouted, ""Metal Gear is now on sale!"" After 5:30 p.m., a friend of our sound staff arrived. His friend was Matsuno-san, the creator of Square's ""FFT."" Like proper businessmen, Matsuno-san and I exchanged business cards on the stairs. We chatted about recent events while we waited. He seemed like a really nice guy. Finally, at 6:00 p.m., the event started. We secured a great spot about five rows from the front. The interior was decorated with lighting, giving it a different feel—almost unrecognizable as Pantheon. The opening was spectacular, with a kung fu action event followed by guest greetings. Guests included Bruce Lee’s wife and Go Nagai. At 7:00 p.m., ""Vampires"" (Vampires: The Last Battle) finally started. The film opened with an interview with John Carpenter. He looked healthier than before, and the interview was quite interesting. Vampires marked Carpenter's comeback!! It was well done. The theme was excellent. This story was perfect for Carpenter. After the movie, Muraoka-san and I had dinner in Harajuku. While drinking beer, I talked about the planning retreat and explained the outline of ""MGS2."" Come to think of it, the first person I discussed the plot and concept of the previous game with was also Muraoka-san. I remember it was at a tea shop in Sannomiya Station. After that, we drank at a bar in Ebisu until midnight.","-98/10/31 (Saturday) I bought a GBC and then just set it aside for now. There aren’t any games that I want, so it will probably end up just lying around not being used. I found the (original) GB Mario in my room. I plugged it into the GB and played it and well, it’s fun. It’s a game at its fundamentals. Only 4 colors and a bit ugly, but still good enough. Left Ebisu with Muraoka and the sound guy. Arrived at Pantheon around 2:15. Saw that the line for Tokyo Fantastic went from the 1st to the 5th floor. Our sound guy hadn’t left work yet, so I asked some guy I didn’t know (in an Escape from LA hat) to hold seats for us, and he saved a good spot on the 2nd floor. I gave him a Metal Gear hat as thanks. We still had over 4 hours, so I went to Tower Records and a book store with Muraoka. I bought a Dark City CD and a Sniper novel. We got back in line again, but it’s quite tough at this age. By coincidence, it turned out that LA guy’s friend was part of Konami group. And he'd brought his girlfriend with him. That made 5 of us in the group. As we got closer to the event starting, the number of TV station cameras there increased. LA guy got caught on camera and did an interview. I don’t know if he lost his mind, but at the end he said “Metal Gear is available now”. A bit after 5:30, our friend from the sound staff arrived. It was Matsuno, who had made FFT for Square. He was exchanging business cards with people on the stairs like a salaryman. We talked about our recent circumstances as we waited. He’s a real good guy. Things finally started at 6. We found our good spot in the 5th or so row from the front. With all the decorations and lighting, it didn’t look like the Parthenon. The opening was spectacular. After a Kungfu action event, they introduced the guests. People like Bruce Lee’s wife, Go Nagai, etc… Then at 7 it was “Vampires”. It started with an interview video with John Carpenter. He seemed more energetic than before. It was quite a good interview. Vampire was so good, it felt like Carpenter was really back! It had good themes. It was a story that had Carpenter written all over it. Once the movie ended, I went to dinner in Harajuku with Muraoka. We talked about a planning boot camp while drinking beer and I explained the outline of MGS2. Now that I think about it, it was Muraoka that I talked to about the plot of the last one too. It was at a café in Sannomiya station if I recall.

Mr. Saka, who played Colonel Cortez, participated, and it was nostalgic to work with him again. As expected, Saka was amazing. When he gets into character, his performance is so intense that it reminds me of Gates Becker. It was so gripping that it made you feel short of breath just listening to it. Several magazines came to the voiceover session to cover the recording. We took a commemorative photo with the voice actors in the studio. Ōtsuka-san (Solid Snake’s voice actor) kindly said, ""Director, please stand in the center!"" but I chose to stand at the far end. It seems Ōtsuka really likes MGS (the role of Snake). Saka’s performance was so outstanding that I started thinking of a character specifically for him in MGS2. Later, I had a casual conversation with Muraoka at a ramen shop in Ginza. We discussed an idea about a legendary sniper who served during the Vietnam War and took down 64 enemies. But in truth, he wasn’t a sniper—he was a spotter. Due to a mistake on his first mission, the real legendary sniper was killed. Now, he works as a security officer on an offshore plant. His beloved wife has passed away, and his only son has distanced himself from him. His past became known, and since then, he's been estranged from his son's family. He knows the offshore plant well and ends up serving as Snake’s spotter in the end. I also thought about a role for Kaneto Shiozawa, but I couldn’t come up with a good part for him. Afterward, I watched The Replacement Killers in Ginza. The content made me think it would have been a great film if John Woo had directed it, even though the story was the same. Chow Yun-Fat didn’t look cool, and the gunfight scenes lacked creativity. Only John Woo knows how to film him in a truly manly way. Today's name: Raiden Branigan. Solidus is gas, a mirage, a non-existent existence.","98/11/9 (Monday) Had a recording for the MGS radio drama (episode 3) at Central Recording from 3. Saka was back to play the role of Colonel Cortez. He really is amazing. It was a realistic performance evocative of Gates Becker. So much so that listening to it feels suffocating. People from a few different magazines came to report on this or that. Took a commemorative photo with the voice actors at the studio. Otsuka told me “director, please get in the middle”, but we took the photo with me on the very end. It seems Otsuka (voice of Snake) really likes MGS. Saka is really great, so I thought about a character for him in MGS2. Had a rambling conversation with Muraoka at a ramen shop in Ginza. A legendary man who worked as a sniper in the Vietnam war, taking out 64 enemies. But actually, he’s not the sniper, but a spotter. He caused that legendary man to miss on his first mission and got him killed. Now he works security at an offshore plant. His beloved wife has passed away, so now he’s devoted to his only son. He then becomes estranged from his son once he finds out about his past. He’s familiar with the interior of the offshore plant. In the end he serves well as a spotter for Snake. I tried thinking of a role for Kaneto Shiozawa too, but no good role came to mind. Saw “the Replacement Killers” in Ginza. I think the same story could have been a lot better if John Woo had made it. Chow Yun-Fat sucked. The gunfights were uninspired. I guess only John Woo can make him look manly. Today’s name. Raiden Brannigan Solidus is gas, haze, an existence that doesn’t exist.","","",""

With a total of 39 people involved, summarizing everything is a major task. I went to Tsutaya with Matsubana to return Breakdown and Hell’s Guard and rented Sniper and Face/Off. This morning’s newspaper had an article about the supercomputer ""Blue Pacific,"" jointly developed by the Livermore Laboratory and IBM. I wondered what such a high-speed computer would be used for, and it turns out it’s for subcritical nuclear testing again. It seems virtual reality nuclear tests are going to become increasingly common. Arsenal Gear will also be equipped with 10 ""Blue Atlantic"" supercomputers running in parallel. It’s not just an arsenal but a system that collects its own data, feeds it back into experiments, and accelerates its readiness for deployment. There’s no longer any need for simulated warhead launch drills. It’s an arsenal of nuclear testing that can be deployed in real combat. I’m thinking of introducing a seasoned veteran who prevents aging with telomerase enzymes. He’s a legendary hero from World War II, the one who taught even Big Boss various strategies. Physically, he’s close to 100 years old and boasts over half a century of combat experience. Codename: ""Old Man,"" a walking history of military strategy. He calls every soldier in the world a ""youngster."" “No one has seen more battlefields than I have. No one alive has been closer to death than I have.” He attacks using a Panzerfaust. I’ll ask Hirano-kun to come up with the detailed equipment. Saka’s voice would be perfect for this character. While having a meeting with Murata-kun about the radio drama, I heard that Kikuko Inoue is returning to the field. I also learned that Akio Ōtsuka is going to appear in a live-action movie.

Today’s newspaper had an article about the supercomputer codeveloped by Livermore Laboratory and IBM, Blue Pacific. I wondered what would you even use such a high speed calculator for, and apparently it’s for subcritical experiments. I guess the use of VR in nuclear testing will become more and more prevalent. The Arsenal Gear would also be equipped with 10 supercomputers (Blue Atlantic). I thought of the Arsenal Gear as not just an arsenal, but something that collects its own data, and provides feedback on experiments in order to deploy in the shortest time possible. There wouldn’t be a need for simulated warhead firing exercises. A nuclear test arsenal deployed in actual warfare. I’ll feature a historic warrior using telomeric oxygen to prevent aging.

"scan/entry_012.png","""【98・11・11(水)】 朝の9時半にCS事業本部に集合、各KCEの開発部長連中、総勢12名でSCE本社に行く。マスター提出でおなじみの1Fロビーでしばらく待たされる。 会議室へ。初めて上がる上階だが、フロアが綺麗なうえ、会う女性会う女性が美しく、こぼれるような笑顔をくれる。やはりSCEだ。 まずは小さな個室に通される。5台の重ねられたプロトタイプPS2 (グラフィックボード) で5種類のデモを観る。確かに凄い! 技術者なら相当のショックかもしれない。しかし、技術無知の僕にとってはさほどではない。特に花火味に跳ね返る際の映り込みや、リフレクション表現のハレーションやレンズフレアが光源計算ではなく、スプライトであるとの説明を聞いたからでもある。これまでのマシンとは比較にならないが、夢のマシンというほどではない。もちろん、臭いも出ない。言うまでもないが、味もない。 最後に「GT」のオープニングムービーのモデル、環境をそのままリアルタイムで流すデモを観る。うーん、さすがにこれは凄い。ちゃんとつくればやはり現状のムービークラスは楽にリアルタイムで表現できる。ムービー指向ゲームには非常に最適なハードであると言える。しかし、「MGS」は違う。今回も見栄え的にかなり不利なことになろう。 場所を移して、技術からスペックの説明を受ける。ゲームマシンらしくない、常軌を逸した怪物高級ハードである。そして、これまでのデータが計算式(演算)に変わる。爆発や風、煙などのエフェクトは演出家の職人芸で見せるのではなく、ミドルウエアという物理計算によってつくり出される。リアルタイム3次元の中に存在する火や水はそのままデータではなく、計算式で表わされている。ここがつくり方で大きく異なる。髪の毛のたなびきはアニメーターによってつくり出されたものだが、物理計算に代わることで、より実写に近づくと同時に個性が失われるかもしれない。 グラフィックのみのハードを1セット、会社に持ち帰る。赤坂から恵比寿までのタクシー内での植原君との複雑なひととき、忘れることはないだろう。 恵比寿に帰ったのち、主要メンバーを集めて概略説明。 「MGS2」はローポリで敵数を膨大 (1000ポリゴンクラスで100兵くらい)に出す方向に行くことを改めて決意する。","November 11, 1998 (Wednesday) At 9:30 a.m., we gathered at the CS Business Headquarters and, with 12 development directors from various KCE divisions, went to the SCE headquarters. We were kept waiting for a while in the familiar 1st-floor lobby, where we submit our masters. We were led to the conference room. It was my first time on the upper floors, and the floor was pristine. Every woman I met there was beautiful, offering radiant smiles. As expected from SCE. We were first shown into a small private room. There, we watched five different demos on five stacked prototype PS2 units (graphics boards). It was truly impressive. If the work is done right, achieving real-time visuals on par with pre-rendered cinematics is very feasible. This hardware is ideal for cinematic-style games. But MGS is different. Visually, we’ll likely still be at a disadvantage. We moved to another room for a technical breakdown of the specs. It’s not just a typical game console—it’s a beast of high-end hardware. What used to be manually crafted data is now being processed through calculations. Effects like explosions, wind, and smoke won’t be handled by a director’s craftsmanship anymore—they’ll be generated in real-time using physics-based middleware. In real-time 3D, elements like fire and water are no longer just static data; they’re represented through dynamic simulations, driven by real-time calculations. This changes the way we approach development significantly. Things like hair movement, which animators used to create by hand, will now be handled through physics simulations. While this brings us closer to realism, it may also lead to a loss of the artistic individuality that animators used to inject into the game. We took one of the graphics hardware sets back to the office. I’ll never forget the complex conversation I had with Uehara-kun during the taxi ride from Akasaka to Ebisu. After returning to Ebisu, I gathered the core team for a briefing. I reaffirmed my decision for MGS2—we'll focus on having a massive number of enemies (about 100 soldiers, each around 1,000 polygons) on-screen, even if it means sticking to low-poly models.","-98/11/11 (Wednesday) We gathered at CS corporate HQ at 9:30, the heads of each KCE development department for a total of 12 people, and all went to SCE together. We waited in the familiar 1st floor lobby to submit the master. Then to the meeting room. As we went up the stairs, I saw the floors were clean and the women we ran into were all beautiful and flashed beaming smiles. That’s SCE for you. First we went into a small room. We watched 5 different types of demos on 5 prototype PS2 (graphics boards) stacked on top of each other. It was great! If I was a technical person, I may have been more appropriately shocked. But for someone technology ignorant like me, it wasn’t anything too special. Especially since I heard that the reflection of fireworks bouncing off the floor, the reflection halation, and lens flare were sprites and not calculated based on light source. It surpasses comparison with previous machines, but it’s not like the machine of my dreams or anything like that. And of course, it’s got no smell. Needless to say, no flavor either. Finally we saw a model of the GT opening cutscene, an environment flowing in real time. Hmm, that really was great. If made properly, one could comfortably express movie class visuals in real time. You could say it's highly suited for cinematic games. However, MGS is different. This sort of display seems rather unhelpful. We changed locations, and went from the technology to getting an explanation on the specifications. It’s a monstrously advanced piece of hardware that dispenses with the norms of game consoles. It also changes in the way it processes data. Effects like explosions, wind, and smoke are not crafted by hand, but produced by physics calculations from something called middleware. Things like fire and water exist in real time 3D not as data, but calculations. This is a big change in how things are made. Where before an animator would make every single hair, with the change to physics calculations, things may get closer to photorealism while also losing their distinctiveness. We brought back 1 set of just the graphics hardware to our company. Had a complex discussion with Uehara in the taxi from Akasaka to Ebisu, I don’t think I’ll forget it. Once we got back to Ebisu, we got the main members together and explained the outline. We reaffirmed our direction with MGS2 would be to have a large number of enemies in low polygon (around 100 soldiers in 1000 polygon-class.)","","",""

I’ve had to switch from WordPerfect to MS Word, as times have changed. Like with this journal, something just feels off. The layout and how the text aligns on the monitor are subtly different. I’ve been using WordPerfect for project proposals and specs ever since Konami switched to Macs—about four years now. Switching from Ichitaro back then also took time to adjust to. During Metal Gear, I wrote everything in WordPerfect. Over the years, I unconsciously developed a rhythm, arranging text, fonts, and layouts in a way that helped maintain a steady flow while writing. It’s not that the commands or interface are hard to use. It’s more of a deeper, instinctual discomfort. Back during Metal Gear, I wrote everything in WordPerfect, and Fukushima handled converting it into MS Word. After a few pages, the discomfort became too much, so I stopped for the day. I ordered the MGS2 logo from Hisashi, asking for one version that doesn’t reuse the old logo and another simplified version. Of course, I joked that we might as well put MGS3 on it. We had to kick Ueno out of the former video editing room (the cave) to install the PS2 graphics evaluation board. Ueno moved to sit next to Hisashi. Kume will set it up tomorrow, and we should be able to see the demo then.","-98/11/12 (Thursday) Wrote up a draft of the plans. Had to switch from the more familiar WORDPERFECT to MS-WORD. That’s how the changing of eras goes. The same goes for this diary, but the sensation just feels different. The layout on the monitor and the kerning are slightly different. I’d been writing up plans and specs on WORDPERFECT ever since Konami started using Macs, already 4 years ago. Ever since Ichitaro it’s always taken me a long time to get used to new software. I wrote everything for Metal Gear on WORDPERFECT. It’s like WORDPERFECT’s distinctive text rows, font size, and layout set a tempo without me realizing it. Well positioning the letters and figures helped me set a rhythm while writing plans. Not that Command or Windows are hard to use, but they feel different. Metal Gear was ultimately something that I originally made in WORDPERFECT and Fukushima converted into MS-WORD. After writing a few pages, things were feeling off, so I decided to call it quits for the day. I ordered Ku-chan (possibly Kumi Sato) to make the logo for MGS2. I requested to keep it simple without reusing the previous logo. And of course, the same will be true for MGS3. I called Ueno from the video editing room to set up a board evaluating the PS2’s graphics. He came in with Ku-chan beside him. I’ll have Kume-chan (possibly Takaaki Kumemura) do the settings tomorrow. I wonder if we’ll be able to see a demo tomorrow.","","",""

Using 600 Snakes naturally made things freeze, so this time we moved around 450 Snakes. It happened to freeze on the first try this evening. Looks like freezing still happens on the PS2. These are just images though. 450 people wriggled around the Metal Gear hangar. It was like the Honolulu marathon. Displaying this many makes things look full. I asked staff how many people they thought it was and they said 1000. That made me happy. The first set of motion data we recorded at IMAGICA last month arrived. You can see Mei Ling’s dojou sukui on it. When I got home, ETV was broadcasting a special on child soldiers. Contents were mostly the same as this morning’s newspaper. Good timing. I thought I could use it for Raiden’s true past (background). The American phonebook I ordered from KOA arrived.

Due to issues in the printing process, only 50 out of the planned 100 types arrived, and I signed those. The cards were coated with a special finish, making it hard for regular markers to stick, so Dewa-kun ran to Mitsukoshi to buy some new pens. Shin-chan and I split the signing duties. Shin-chan’s pen flowed smoothly, while my pen pressure was too strong. The difference in our signatures was huge. My signature spread out too much, to the point where the letters were almost crushed and ruined the card’s design. The numbers in ""1998,"" especially the 9 and 8, were practically unrecognizable. I worried, ""The people who get this might be upset!"" as I kept signing. Still, the cards turned out great, and Dewa-kun looked really satisfied with his work. I finished writing the large concept document (preliminary version) and uploaded it to the shared server. Now the key members of MGS2 can view it. Since I used some Mac-specific characters (like arrows) on my Mac, it seems they won’t display properly in HTML. Today’s menu at Takabe’s secret lab included bendable pin lights. It’s the same technique that was developed for the PlayStation but ultimately scrapped. Six or seven lights wriggled around on the screen, bending when they hit walls or obstacles. This time, it looks like it’ll work! However, if the lights hit thin walls like a folding screen, they still pass through, so we’ll need to carefully choose where to use it. Since Takabe-kun only worked a half day today, this was the only task completed. It looks like he’ll be working through the weekend. Watching him makes me envy engineers—PS2 really seems like a lot of fun. I went swimming at the sports club. I swam 12 laps today, but that’s still only 700 meters. Fridays are usually less crowded, but the pool lanes were busy. Christmas songs were playing non-stop in the sauna and throughout the club.

Due to some issues with the printing process, I didn’t receive the full 100 that were planned, and just wrote on the 50 that did come. They have a special coating so an ordinary magic marker doesn’t write well on them, so Dewa ran off to get something from Mitsukoshi. I signed them with Shin-chan (possibly Yoji Shinkawa) half at a time. My pen glided smoothly across the paper. I pushed down hard with the pen. There was a lot of range in the results. My signature took up a lot of space, with the letters smudged and the card design put to waste. Like where it says 1998, you can’t even tell what the 9 and 8 are. “Whoever receives this might be mad”, I thought as I kept signing cards. But these trading cards…..came out well. Dewa also looked happy to have another job completed. I finished writing the planning draft and put it on the shared server. Now the main MGS2 members can see it.

Today's menu at Takabe's secret lab: shadows affected by pin spotlights. The shadows stretch and change shape with the movement of the light, curving around on top of a real round oil drum, and bending when they hit the wall. It’s exactly the shadow processing I’ve been dreaming of. We even got multiple shadows appearing from different light sources... We’ve managed to get it working. But lately, nothing has really surprised me. It feels like something’s missing. If we keep adding this and that, there’s a risk of weakening the visual impact. Focusing too much on shadows and lighting could reduce the number of soldiers on screen. A more cinematic approach with fewer, more detailed polygons might be easier to understand and more likely to succeed... I’m starting to doubt the direction again. However, even if we aim for movie-like CG, we won’t be able to create the ""experience"" (sense of immersion) I want. In the end, it's about content. No matter what anyone says, I’m going to keep going down this path. I found a nonfiction book called The Nazi Saboteurs of the Atomic Bomb. Flipping through it, the codename ""Mikkel"" caught my eye. I’m not sure what language it’s from, but it seems to mean ""Fox."" It was a codename given to operatives involved in special operations against the Nazis.

This processing is like something out of a dream. And many shadows appear when there are multiple light sources…. It displays alright. Nothing real surprising here. I feel like there’s something missing, but I worry if I request this or that it will cheapen the visual impact. Investing too much into lights and shadows won’t leave room for many soldiers. Focusing cinematically on a single point with simple polygons may be the way to go…. I’m still undecided on what direction to take things. However, there’s no one to create the experience (immersion) I want by going after cinematic CG. It all comes down to the contents. That’s the route we need to take. I found a nonfiction book called Blood and Water: Sabotaging Hitler’s Bomb. Skimming through it, the codename “mikkel” caught my eye. I don’t know in what language, but apparently it means “fox”. It must have been the code name for some spy working on Nazi related operations. I want the codenames (protagonist and Dead Cell) to be weapon names this time (Raiden, Fatman, etc.).

At the company, Zelda has become a craze among some people. Even Johnny and Nakamura-kun, who are usually very picky about games, are praising it highly. It seems that Nishimura-kun and Uehara-kun are engrossed in it every day until morning. I'm kind of envious. For someone like me who gets 3D motion sickness, it's a bit daunting to try again. What everyone says unanimously is how difficult the game is. Right from the beginning (the first boss enemy), it demands high-level action skills. Even Muraoka-san got stuck at the first boss. He was asking Okamura during lunch how to defeat it. As for the puzzles, it seems they're so challenging that you absolutely can't solve them without a strategy guide.

Certainly, the fun of action games lies there. It's also the issue I struggled with until the end when adjusting the difficulty of MGS. Why did I worry? Because it's clearly a different era now compared to when Metal was released on the MSX. Prices, global affairs, users, and values have all changed. That's why I was so conflicted. When I talk to various people, it seems that MGS overlaps quite a bit with Zelda in terms of content and ideas.

Zelda is really trending in parts of the company. Johnny is always loud about games, and Nakamura and the others have been raving about it. It appears Nishimura, Uehara, etc. are glued to it every day until morning. I’m kind of jealous. With how rough 3D is on me, giving it another go will be a pain. The thing everyone talks about is the game’s difficulty. From the start (the first boss), it’s high intensity action. Muraoka got stuck on the first boss. I heard Okamura talk about how to beat it at lunch time. The game’s puzzles seem unsolvable without a strategy guide. Yet everyone who plays Zelda say that “that’s what makes you so happy when you do solve them!” “It’s a game that’s got something to it, with so many underwhelming games lately, it’s the first game in while that feels like a game. It’s because it’s difficult that getting through it makes you really feel like you’re playing a game. Recent games play you instead of you playing them, but this is a real game….” That’s what everyone says. I guess that is what makes for a fun action game. Adjusting the difficulty of MGS was a problem I stressed over until the end. Why did it worry me? Because this is obviously a different era from when Metal released on MSX. Prices, global circumstances, players, and values have changed. That’s why I worried so much. When asking a lot of people about the ideas on MGS, there’s quite a lot of overlap. It looks like the way to go is diving deeper into 3D polygon action. I worked on the background for Raiden and the protagonist. I put most of the first draft on the server. I also wrote up an item box heading and uploaded it. Today’s menu at Takabe’s secret lab: Multiple bodies of water.

I worked on the character settings for Solidus. To avoid making Solidus an absolute villain, I decided to introduce a group of elderly people called ""The Patriots,"" who secretly control national defense. I realized today that I had been misunderstanding the meaning of ""SOLIDUS"" up until now. When I checked with Okaji, it turns out it refers to the phase boundary where something is neither water nor ice. I'll be changing the associated imagery and lines. Apparently, it refers to the curve that shows the relationship between the melting point and the composition of the solid phase — a solidus line. Just before leaving, I watched Godzilla on the Dreamcast. It actually looks pretty interesting. The backgrounds, textures, and camera work are a bit off, but if done properly, it could have been quite good. Ifukube's music is awesome. The third stage takes place in Osaka, Umeda.

Rising from the ranks of a sailor, he seems to have embodied the American Dream among a navy full of elites. It seems only someone like him could have thought up the idea of the Arsenal Ship. If ships like the Arsenal spread, the navy’s role would diminish. It also went against the Navy spirit and was seen as an unappealing idea. He faced heavy criticism from elite officers like aviators and submariners. In MGS2, I’ll set it up so that the Marines take over the Arsenal Ship project. I began preparations for tomorrow's PS2 presentation. I arranged the tables in the seminar room and set up the venue. I also ordered signs from Kyu-chan to guide people to the restrooms and vending machines. Honestly, we could charge an entry fee for this. According to the email tally, there will be 20 people at tomorrow’s presentation. Thanks to everyone for the hard work. It took almost all day to fit the explanatory VTR into an 8mm tape. I cut the footage into 1-minute sections, with looping visuals in between. During these sections, Takabe-kun will provide commentary. In the evening, we held a rehearsal in the seminar room. Since the screen was dim, we turned off the lights. The large screen had great impact, but through video, details like anti-aliasing were hard to notice. I used Okaji to test the reaction from a general audience. He was astonished by the 450 Snakes and let out a shriek. It was a success. I’m debating whether to show it to the MGS2 team tomorrow. In any case, other departments at KCE will see it tomorrow. I really want to ask Kyle Cooper to make the title sequence for MGS2. He worked on Eraser, Mission: Impossible, and Twister... now that I think of it, they all had that Kyle Cooper style. I have a newfound appreciation for his talent. I’ve set my heart on asking him. Kyle was born in August 1963, the same year and month as me. Same star sign, same fate. The materials Kyu-chan gave me included the address, phone number, and contact info for his company, Imaginary Forces. I’ll try reaching out after the new year.

This was the first unveiling of the PS2 to the team. In about 15 minutes, Takabe-kun finished his explanation and we showed the PS2 demo video. I asked for their thoughts, but it didn’t seem to make that much of an impact. Compared to the PS and Dreamcast, the general impression was just that it could handle a large number of polygons. Perhaps the anticipation was so high because it had been so difficult to see the PS2 until now, and they had overreacted in their minds. According to Uehara-kun, it's an amazing piece of hardware. Even so, Toyopee was pleased with it. That’s right—this kind of positive attitude feels refreshing right now. At 2:00 PM, we held the PS2 briefing. We pushed right up to the last minute to get footage ready of five Metal Gear units plus five Snake units. When the legs of the Metal Gears appeared, they really did look big. I felt like we could pull this off. As expected, there were a lot of unfamiliar faces. We started the briefing five minutes late. With Uehara-kun's relaxed atmosphere and tone, he explained the PS2 specs. Honestly, no matter how many times I hear it, I still don’t really understand it. The audience's reaction was strangely quiet. If this had been a school lesson, they definitely would have fallen asleep. I felt a sense of alienation, like I didn’t belong there. Maybe this profession isn’t right for me. Finally, we got to the explanation of the GS (Graphics Synthesizer), using the video. The lights dimmed, and the video started. The SCE logo and PS mark appeared... """"Damn, this isn’t landing!"""" No one laughed. The opening had clearly failed. When the footage of 450 Snakes appeared, there was an audible gasp from the audience, but the reaction still wasn’t as big as I’d expected. After the video, we split the attendees into groups of six and took them into individual rooms in the secret lab to see the live footage on the actual hardware. Since individual hardware viewings were inefficient, we changed the schedule and moved into a Q&A session. Uehara-kun answered politely. By that point, I had no idea what was going on. He was throwing out equations and numbers with a smile, but I had no clue what was supposed to be funny. I got an email from Scott informing me that """"MGS"""" was selected as """"Game of the Year"""" by Official PlayStation Magazine. Wait, what? Where’s """"Zelda""""? That thought crossed my mind, but then I remembered this was PlayStation Magazine. Shin-chan bought a comic book magazine that had a full-page ad for the """"MGS"""" action figures from McFarlane Toys, set to release in February next year. Yoshiike-kun rented the video """"Eyes Without a Face"""" for me. I half-jokingly said, """"Watch it because it's scary!"""" but it seems he took me seriously and rented it. It's a French film I saw as a kid that scared me intensely.""","98/12/2 (Wednesday) The main MGS2 staff members gathered in the seminar room at 10:30 and we held the preparations for the PS2 briefing session. This was the first time the PS2 was unveiled to the members. Takabe’s explanation and the cutscenes recorded on video finished in 15 minutes. When I asked people for their thoughts, they weren’t all that shocked. Just that they saw the number of polygons was a lot higher than the previous PS and DC. It must be that they had high expectations, and having not seen much of the PS2, I overestimated things in my head. According to Uehara, it’s a great piece of hardware. Toyopi (So Toyota) was happy with it. Yeah, looking forward is the way to go. We held the PS2 debriefing session at 2:00. We were patching things up right until start time to have a video of 5 metal gears and 5 Snakes ready. When the metal gears extend their legs, you get a real sense of their size. I felt like things looked pretty good. As expected, it was all people I didn’t know in attendance. The session started 5 minutes late. Uehara gave a relaxed explanation of the PS2 specs. No matter how many times I hear it I still don’t quite understand it. The response from the attendees was rather quiet for some reason. If this was a class at school, they’d definitely have been sleeping. It felt like they had shown up to the wrong place. Maybe they’re not suited for this industry. We then entered an explanation using video before the explanation on GS (graphic synthesizers). The lights were turned off, and the video began. The SCE logo and PS mark appeared…. “Damn, they’re not going for it!!” No one smiled. It obviously failed to pull them in…. The sight of 450 Snakes got a few gasps from the viewers, but it wasn’t as much of a reaction as I thought it would be. After the video finished, we had people break into groups of 6 to enter the secret lab and see videos on the actual machine. Having them view the actual machine individually turned out to be ineffective, so we made a change of plans and entered a Q&A. Uehara politely answered questions. I had no idea what he was talking about. He smiled as he talked about substitution expressions and number directives, but I have no idea what about it was interesting. I got an email from Scott that MGS had been chosen by the official PlayStation magazine for “game of the year.” “Huh? What about Zelda?”, I thought, before remembering that it was the PlayStation magazine. An American comic magazine that Shin-chan had bought included an ad for MGS action figures by McFarlane Toys. Apparently they release February next year.

The ""Yamashita Stage"" has a bad reputation among the staff, but it's actually well thought out as a stage. The issue isn't the puzzle-solving aspect, but rather the fact that the solution is vague. The answer isn't clear. I'd like to add stages with puzzle elements that require more brainpower, not just technique. I worked on writing the VR disc specifications. Mineshi is creating the background for the ninja stage. Since the evaluation for ""Z.O.E"" is tomorrow, I spent most of my time over in that area. As a result, I couldn’t make any progress on the ""MGS2"" planning today either. The Mei Ling model for the survival photo shoot was displayed. It didn’t seem very lifelike, so I asked them to apply environmental mapping to the eyes. I wasn’t expecting much, but... this is good! They look a bit like doll eyes, but I feel like some light has broken through. This direction seems promising. While it doesn’t look entirely human, it gives off the sense of a different kind of life. If we tone down the alpha blend of the environmental mapping a bit, it might create a nice moistness in the eyes. Encouraged by this, I asked them to make a separate model for the lower lip and apply environmental mapping to it as well. If this works, the lips could shine like in a cosmetics commercial. I also plan to have them apply environmental mapping to the teeth in ""MGS2."" After all, the life of a doll is in its eyes and mouth. Okajii's eye movement program was implemented, making Mei Ling’s eyes move in an unnatural way. Going forward, we’ll need data to specify the gaze direction along with the motion data. It might be best to link the gaze with the motion to some extent and specify it when creating the demo. This might make demo creation more of a hassle. I want the enemy soldiers to react to Snake’s weapons and equipment. I’m also thinking of events where they follow his line of sight. I asked myself: How do things look natural? Naturally, skin and clothing have different materials and colors, so in the real world, they reflect light differently. The reflectivity is different. Black objects absorb light. In other words, in nature, the appearance of things varies depending on their color and material. This is because each has a different level of reflectivity. Current CG doesn’t reflect this. No matter how much we try to work textures into the model, skin, clothes, and buttons all reflect light the same way. As a result, they end up looking like the paper assembly kits that come as extras in Gakken’s Science and Learning magazines. If we could selectively turn shading on and off for different parts, we could create a more convincing effect. Ideally, I’d like to have subtle differences in reflectivity rather than just on/off shading, but none of the programmers seemed enthusiastic when I mentioned it. There’s one more challenge for today: wrinkle representation. Should we simulate wrinkles physically, or should we prepare texture-based illustrations of wrinkles and use morphing techniques? Toray has apparently developed a cloth simulator for clothing design that calculates the wrinkles and draping of fabric based on the selected material for the model. Of course, it’s not in real-time. It seems that Synergy Geomatics has gone bankrupt. I read an article about it in a newspaper column. It’s a bit of a shock. Back in the days of the PC-98 and 3DO, Synergy was a giant in the multimedia world. I went swimming at the sports club. The Bee Gees’ Massachusetts was playing.","-98/12/8 (Tuesday) Evaluated the remaining VR stages (special) in the morning.

I want to add stages with puzzles that test intellect over technique. I wrote up some specs for the VR disc. Mineshi made the backgrounds for the ninja stage. The Z.O.E. evaluation is tomorrow, so we mostly focused on that. As a result, I didn’t get anything done on the MGS2 plans today. A model of Mei Ling displays in the survivor photography mode. She didn’t look very lifelike, so I had someone do environmental mapping on her eye balls. Not that my expectations were all that high…. This is good!! Although they look a bit like doll eyes. It’s like a ray of hope has dawned for her. This decoration looks pretty good. She doesn’t look all that human, but like some other kind of life. If we tweak the environmental mapping alpha blend a bit more, we might get some good eye moisture. And if I feel like it, I’ll have them make the bottom lip as a separate model and have it environmentally mapped. If that succeeds, her lips will be as gleaming and lustrous as something out of a makeup commercial. I plan to have teeth environmentally mapped in MGS2. The life of a doll comes from it’s eyes and mouth. We entered in Okaji’s (Okamura?) eyeball programming, and Mei Ling’s eyes moved strangely. Next we’ll need data to direct her gaze alongside motion data. Having it linked with her motion to an extent and directing the rest when making cutscenes might be good. Making those cutscenes will probably be a pain though. I want enemy soldiers to act when they see Snake’s weapons and equipment. I’m also thinking of events where they proceed based on where their partners are looking. I wondered about what makes things look natural. Of course with skin and clothes, their materials and colors are different, so they reflect differently than in the real world. The reflectance ratio is different. Furthermore, black things absorb light. Essentially, in nature, things look different depending on their color and material. That’s not what happens with current CG. No matter how much you put into textures, skin, clothes, and buttons all reflect the same. That’s why they all look like paper model kits. You can turn the shooting on or off for individual pieces, but really it’s not a matter of on/off, but slight variations in reflectance ratio that you want. Even if I say that to programmers, no one has a good response. There was one other topic today: displaying wrinkles. Either simulating them physically or creating a texture with wrinkles on it and morphing it. Toray Industries is developing a fabric simulator for use in designing clothing that can calculate how fabric will wrinkle and flow. But of course, it’s not in real time. It appears Synergy Interactive went bankrupt. There was an article about it in a newspaper column. I was a bit shocked. Synergy was a leader in multimedia back in the days of PC-98 and 3DO. I swam at the sports club. “Massachusetts” by the Bee Gees was playing.","Gakken (学研): A well-known Japanese educational publishing company that produces magazines like Science (科学) and Learning (学習), often including supplementary paper assembly kits for educational purposes.

Using the models and motions from the photo shoot, I created the polygon cutscene for the opening. We displayed the Mei Ling model for the render evaluation on the PS2. As expected, the high resolution makes it look beautiful. Even the bangs look convincingly like hair. However, it doesn’t feel surprising. Since the textures come through so clearly, adding any touch-ups or stylization might not be a good idea. Since the hardware doesn’t support bump mapping, it might be more effective to create details with polygons and use lighting for shading. We might need to hire a lighting specialist. On the PS2, modeling is key. You tend to rely on textures to compensate, but that won’t cut it here.","-98/12/9 (Wednesday) I wrote the VR specification documents. Also made an opening polygon cutscene using models and animations from photography mode. I used the PS2 photography mode Mei Ling. She’s high resolution and pretty. Her bangs look like real hair. However, nothing surprising. If the textures are too straight, it will be tough to add in details. There’s no bump mapping feature on the hardware, so details need to be made with polygons, and using light to create shadows may be effective. I may need to employ a lighting specialist. The PS2 is all about the modelling. There’s no taking shortcuts with the textures.","","",""

It seems that Mouri-san wants to contribute to the scenario, but since ""Metal Gear"" is, after all, a ""game,"" we’ll handle the scenario internally. As long as ""MGS2"" is a game, the narrative has to be tied to game mechanics. That part can’t be entrusted to someone else. Like in the previous game, Mouri-san will focus on being an advisor. His main responsibilities will include checking the plot and settings, and supervising the tactics and behavior of enemy soldiers. Of course, we also plan to rely on Mouri-san’s connections for research. Since the release of ""MGS,"" Mouri-san has been flooded with offers from the game industry, most of which are requests for him to write scenarios. I emphasized again that, like before, his involvement would be broad but not too deep this time. It’s a somewhat difficult request, but Mouri-san seemed happy to accept it. Around March, when the game’s overall structure becomes clearer, we’ll negotiate again, have him check things over, and exchange opinions. The PocketStation arrived at the company today. Just this morning, I heard the news that its release had been delayed from December 23 to the end of January. Holding it in my hands, I find it incredibly cute and cool at the same time. It’s a wonderful design. I hadn’t been that interested before, but now that I’ve seen it, I want one. It's not about the functionality—it’s the design alone that’s enough of a reason to buy it. Even the back is refined, and it has a high-end feel. It works as a fashion item. It wouldn’t be strange to see a girl wearing one around her neck. As I fiddled with the real thing, ideas started pouring out like a fountain. The PocketStation is that kind of item. Just holding or looking at it is fun. Since infrared is a concept that hasn’t existed in game consoles before, there are new possibilities. I urgently wrote the specifications for PocketStation integration in the ""Integral"" version. We’ll proceed with the original plan of the ""Ring Project."" Since the programming is in assembly, I’ll leave it to Okajii. The pixel art will be handled by the master dot artist Nakamura-kun.

At the ""2nd Agency for Cultural Affairs Media Arts Festival,"" hosted by the Agency for Cultural Affairs, we won the Excellence Prize in the Digital Art Interactive Division. I received notice of the award from the CS division. At first, I thought we had won the Grand Prize, but after carefully reading the email, it turned out to be just the Excellence Prize. As expected, the Grand Prize will likely go to ""Zelda."" Mei Ling is now properly displayed on the PS2. But even with the proper display, there’s nothing particularly special about it.

It’s not something we can leave to someone else. We’ll have Mouri as an advisor, same as with the last one. He’ll check major contents like the plot, backgrounds, and direct enemy soldier strategy. I also plan to use Mouri’s personal connections to help get some information. It seems that since the release of MGS, Mouri has gotten a deluge of offers from the gaming industry, with the majority asking him to handle the stories. I emphasized to Mouri again that this will be a long and shallow involvement. It’s an extremely hard thing to ask, but he seems happy to take it on. Once the outline of the game takes shape around March, we’ll negotiate, have him check things, and exchange opinions again. The pocket station was delivered to the company just this morning. I had just heard the news that the release date was changed from December 23rd to the end of January. Having it in hand, it’s extremely cute and cool. It’s a fantastic design. I hadn’t had much interest in it until now, but seeing it in person made me want one for the first time. Regardless of its features, just the design is enough to get me to buy one. It’s polished even on the inside, and feels high quality. It could work as a fashion item. It wouldn’t look weird if girls wore it around their necks. Messing around with it, I was flooded with a well of ideas. That’s just what the pocket station does to you. Even just holding it and looking at it is fun. The general idea is that it uses infrared unlike previous game consoles, allowing for new possibilities. I urgently wrote up some specs for a pocket station version of Integral. We went with Ring Project as initially planned. It’s programmed in Assembly, so I’ll have Okaji (Okamura) handle it. The pixel art will be done by graphic artist Nakamura.

When you add a lot of blur, it creates a soft-focus-like effect. The neck polygons stand out, so I had them add bones to the neck and asked them to look into whether we can split the polygons only when it bends unnaturally. In any case, everything will be determined through future experiments. I’ll have Shin-chan work on the mecha design for Z.O.E within this month.

After all, it’s a design from six years ago. We’ll refine it. I believe the six-year time gap will work in our favor, like fashion trends. The protagonist’s mech will have a face embedded in the head. When the face guard opens, it will reveal a demonic expression, just like Devilman. The face will be unveiled at the end. The enemy mechs will have skulls. Since the cockpit is positioned in the groin area, I’ve asked for a ""Dick Seat"" that can erect (stand up). I want to incorporate this into the world’s lingo, so they’ll say things like, ""Aim for the enemy’s weak spot (dick)!"" Additionally, robots that have been in space for a long time will be parasitized by spaceship lice and Martian barnacles, which will appear to have colonized them. As the robots walk, the lice will fall out of the colony like droplets. When Shin-chan and I get involved, the game clearly heads in a different direction. However, I can feel a certain energy taking shape. I prepared the project proposal for Z.O.E. A box of MGS trading cards arrived. Since there weren’t enough for the entire staff, we’ll hold a lottery. Still, only one die-cut card came out of the pack… that must make it quite valuable. Mei Ling’s neck was fixed.

This was a military response by the US to Iraq's refusal to allow nuclear inspections. This airstrike occurred without international consent. The bombing lasted for six hours. There were images of craters created by the bombing in Baghdad and injured people receiving treatment in bed. I was deeply shocked. It reminded me of the Gulf War in 1991. At that time, I watched the news about the airstrikes at work. This morning’s first report also featured similar green-tinted night vision footage. It gave me a very grim feeling. Can conflict really not be avoided? It’s the same cycle repeating. What is the UN doing? I’m concerned about the scale of this conflict. Will it drag on? Will it expand? It seems Clinton is determined to completely crush Hussein. If the conflict escalates, drags on, and turns into a full-scale war, the development of MGS2 may have to be scrapped. I feel a deep sense of sorrow. Even if the conflict remains limited, we would still have to change MGS2's scenario. The content is just too sensitive. The story takes place in the near future of the 21st century, where suspicions arise about Metal Gear development in Iraq. The UN demands inspections, but Iraq refuses, and the inspection team, which begins forced inspections, is taken hostage by Iraq. The story starts with tensions rising between Iraq and the US. It’s not just timely—it’s almost identical to real events. If this actually happens in reality, it would rob the fiction of its value and entertainment meaning. If a real meteor were heading toward Earth, no one would go to see Deep Impact or Armageddon. Moreover, from an ethical standpoint, it would be inappropriate to make light of real-world events in a game. The story of MGS can only exist in a world where peace prevails. The name ""Operation Desert Fox"" also reminds me of MGS. There are even rumors that stealth and bunker buster bombs were used. It’s extremely unpleasant and regrettable. I received a box of MGS trading cards. I’ll open one pack each day.","98/12/17 (Thursday) When I turned on the TV at 7 AM, I saw news that the UK and US were air striking Iraq. America’s response to the refusal of nuclear inspections was use of military force. These air strikes do not have international consensus. It appears the strikes went on for 6 hours. They showed footage of injured people receiving medical treatment in a crater created by the air strikes in Baghdad. I was extremely shocked. I remember the ’91 Gulf War. I was at work when I saw the news that air strikes were commencing. It was the first story that morning, green video taken with night vision filming. I felt extremely sad and gloomy. Is war unavoidable? The same thing keeps happening. What is the UN even doing? What will the scope of this war be? Will it draw out a long time? That concerns me. Clinton intends to thoroughly crush Hussein. If the conflict expands, and turns into a protracted war, I’ll have to call off the plans for MGS2. It will bring up painful memories. I’ll need to change the plot of MGS2 if it causes even the slightest offence, since the contents are rather touchy. Will put doubts of metal gear being developed in Iraq in the near future of the 21st century at the forefront. The UN request an inspection, but Iraq denies it, and when a team arrives to conduct a coercive inspection, they’re taken hostage by Iraq. The story begins with building tension between Iraq and America. Rather than being relevant, it’s just the facts as they are. If it happens in real life, then it loses its value as fiction and entertainment. If a meteorite actually fell down to Earth, then no one would go see Deep Impact or Armageddon. From an ethical perspective as well, it’s wrong to poke fun at current events in a video game. MGS is a story that doesn’t work if there isn’t peace in the world. The naming of Operation Desert Fox also makes me think of MGS. There are rumors of stealth and infiltrating bunkers as well. I feel exceedingly unhappy and regretful.

The scale is expanding. It seems the South Korean Navy has sunk one of its own small submarines. Was it in South Korean waters? What were they doing? Were they on a special mission? At the KCE (Konami Computer Entertainment) School, we held a special lecture by the MGS team. Uehara, Mizutani, Muraoka, and I participated. When we arrived at the venue on the 8th floor of Mori Building 25, the setup was already complete. The main hall could hold 100 people, and the lecture was broadcast via camera to another 100 people outside who couldn’t fit in the hall. As an icebreaker, I introduced the staff and showed a video of Mei Ling (facial animation), but there wasn’t much of a reaction. Then, Uehara-kun, Mizutani-kun, and Muraoka-san each gave a 20-minute lecture in that order. We had prepared for 20 minutes of Q&A afterward. Overall, I think it went fairly well. I received Sonic from SEGA's Naka-san. It looks like they made the release in time—amazing, really amazing. We all played it right away. I went swimming at the sports club. Since it’s the end of the year and people are likely busy with year-end parties and other activities, it was the least crowded I’ve ever seen it. I had one lane (specifically for turns) all to myself, and the lane next to it was empty too.","98/12/18 (Friday) Second day of airstrikes on Iraq. The scale of the war is expanding.

The MGS team held a special lecture at KCE school. Uehara, Mizutani, Muraoka, and I participated. Everything was already set up at the venue when we arrived at the 8th floor of 25 Mori Building. There was seating for 100 people, cameras to broadcast to people elsewhere, and another 100 people that couldn’t fit in listening from outside.

From there came Uehara, then Mizutani, then Muraoka, lecturing for 20 minutes each. Then we did 20 minutes of Q&A. I think it went alright. Got Sonic delivered from Naka from SEGA.

I used to catch colds very easily in winter, but I haven’t had one in the past six months. Well, I did have other issues, like stomach pain. When I think about it, the fact that I didn’t get a cold during the MGS wrap-up period must mean I was really tense at the time. I had a meeting with Okamura about the plot for Z.O.E.

Although our positions differ, we both share the same struggles and dilemmas of balancing the roles of developer and producer in the field.","98/12/21 (Monday) Caught a cold for the first time in half a year.

I’m the type that tends to catch a cold as soon as winter hits, but I hadn’t caught a cold this last half year. Well, I had had other illnesses and stomach pain.

I’ve been so busy over the year-end and New Year’s period that I couldn’t find the time to write after coming home. Habits are scary—once you slack off, you tend to be lazy the next day too. Before I knew it, I hadn’t written for over two weeks. That was close. If this keeps up, I might stop writing my diary altogether… Starting today, I’m finally back to working on MGS2 after several months. It’s been so long that I’ve forgotten the plot. This is bad. I worked on fleshing out the boss battles and character settings. Recently, I’d been worrying, ""Am I getting too old for this?"" But ideas and visuals came flooding in one after another. Especially when I started writing out the rough script for the boss battles, the ideas just wouldn’t stop. The imagery kept expanding in my mind. It was fun. I was impressed with myself. It’s been a while since I’ve felt impressed by my own talent. It seems I’ve still got it. However, there are too many characters and the twists are too complicated, so I need to simplify it a bit more. Personally, I don’t think a game needs a complex story, but considering the expectations of players from the previous game, it seems one of MGS's main attractions is its story. This is something I find hard to understand myself. But when I read comments like, ""The plot twists were great!"" or ""I hope the next one surprises us even more!"" I realize those elements are necessary. I might scrap the boss character ""Old Man."" Tomorrow, I’ll make a list and try to balance it with the previous game. On the way home, I found myself fixated on the idea of including a female ninja. There are at least three characters from the previous game that players would project onto a female ninja: Meryl, Naomi, and Wolf. Any of these characters could work as the ninja in this game, but none of them really fit. It would take the story too far off track. Originally, I thought about bringing back Ocelot in a powered exoskeleton, but visually, a female ninja with a prominent chest just looks better. Today’s conclusion is to consider a female ninja character that doesn’t directly relate to any of the three mentioned. The idea is to introduce a female ninja as part of the S3 Plan, who assists Raiden. This would help bring Raiden’s experience closer to Snake’s. I’ll hire three voice actresses and use digital tricks to change the voice in different scenes. In Honolulu, I watched a Magic Polynesian Show. It was an old-school fire dance mixed with magic, a modern version of a Polynesian show. As expected from the entertainment capital, America. At first, I was skeptical, but it was quite impressive. After seeing that magic show, I suddenly felt a strong urge to include a magician as a boss enemy. I imagine a scene where the magician pulls out an empty box, covers it with a cloth, and then, to everyone’s surprise, removes the cloth to reveal enemy soldiers pouring out of the box. I ran the idea by a few of the staff, but it wasn’t well-received. For the first time in years, I bought a copy of Eureka. It’s almost entirely a special issue on Paul Auster. It looks like it’s packed with good content. I want to finish reading The Locked Room soon. I decided to name Raiden’s real name ""Fanshawe."" I also want to use the name ""Quinn,"" the protagonist of City of Glass, somewhere in the game. I was shown the latest character model from Mizupin. The shoulder, waist, and toe structures have improved significantly. Now we just need to figure out what to do about the hair. A nasty cold is spreading through the office. Shin-chan hasn’t shown up since the start of the year. I started feeling unwell too, so I bought some liquid cold medicine from the pharmacy and took it. I went home early.","99/1/7 (Thursday) My first diary in 2 weeks. I was busy from year end through the start of the new year, so didn’t really have time to write when I got home at night. That’s the terrifying part about habits, how you skip them once then find yourself neglecting them the next day too. Before I knew it, I’d gone 2 weeks without writing. That’s dangerous, that’s dangerous. At this rate I’ll end up quitting the diary all together… Went back to the MGS2 plans for the first time in a few months. It had been so long I’d forgotten the plot. That’s bad. Worked on working in the boss battles and the character settings. Recently I’d been worrying that I might be getting too old, but ideas and visuals came to me one after another. Especially with the boss battle (rough) ideas, I couldn’t stop writing. My vision is expanding. It’s so fun. I’m impressed with myself. For the first time in a while, I felt charmed by my own talent. Looks like I’ve still got it. However, there are so many characters, and the plot twist was too complex, so I need to revise and simplify things again. I think that games don’t need complicated stories, but looking at the expectations of players of the last game, it seems that the story was part of MGS’s appeal. I myself struggle to understand it. But when I read opinions on how “the plot twist was good” and “I want my expectations to be even more subverted next time”, it encouraged me that those sorts of elements would be necessary. I might cancel the boss character “Old Man”. I’ll make a list tomorrow and strike a balance with the previous game. On the way home, I felt that I really want to add in a female ninja. There are at least 3 characters from the last game that players will project the female ninja to be, Meryl, Naomi, and Wolf. No matter which ninja appears, the story could work, but none of them feel right. It would be too big a departure from the main story. At first I thought of having Ocelot with a reinforced build appear, but visually, a female ninja with pronounced breasts is better. My conclusion today is of those 3, I’ll look into it being none of them. Maybe I’ll have a ninja appear and help Raiden as part of S3. That will bring her close to an environment Snake has experienced. I’ll use all 3 voice actresses, changing them from scene to scene using digital tricks. Saw the Magic Polynesian Show in Honolulu. It combined ancient fire walking with magic. It’s like a modern take on Polynesian Show. It’s what you’d expect from the land of entertainment, America. As soon as I saw that magic, I knew I had to add in a genderless magician boss character. They bring out an empty box, cover it in cloth, and then when they take it away again, amazingly, enemies come bustling out from inside. I pitched the idea to a few staff, but they didn’t really go for it. Bought a copy of “Yuriika” for the first time in years. It was mainly a special feature on Paul Auster. The contents were pretty in depth. I’ll need to read “The Locked Room” soon. Made Raiden’s real name Fanshawe. I also want to use the name Quinn, the main character of “City of Glass”, somewhere as well. Mizupin showed me his latest human models. The shoulder composition, waist composition, and toes have really improved. Now we just need to figure out what to do with the hair. The flu is spreading around the office quite severely. Shin-chan hasn’t been to work since New Year’s. I was feeling bad too, so I bought some liquid cold medicine at the pharmacy and took it. I went home early.","","",""
"scan/entry_040.png","""99-1-11 (月) 今日は『ゲーム批評』の原稿、「スネーク・アイズとデ・パルマ」を書く。映画を観てから、すでに数週間以上経っているので、内容をあまり覚えていない。まあ、年末、機内でなんとなく2回目を観たので、そうでもないが。書こうと思っていたことを忘れてしまったのは最悪のひと言に尽きる。結局、今年の1回目からあまりいい原稿を書けなかった。幸先いいスタートとはいい難い。昨日、息子と引いた「親子ダブル大吉」は、それほど信憑性がないのだろうか。かえってあまりよくない前兆であろうか。 没にしようと思っていた「オールドマン」だが、今朝、平野君が設定と参考資料を持ってきてくれた。あまりにも濃い内容、そのままは使えないが、面白いところもある。少女を2名連れての攻撃 (ワルキューレ)は、倫理的にはとうてい無理。オールドマン、復活か? 新ちゃんが今年初めて出社する。頼むぜ、新川洋司、もう少し体を鍛えろ!!! 「MGS2」の草案書とキャラ設定を渡す。「Z.O.E」は保留。これまでのラフをファイルにまとめてもらう。水ビンを中心に「MGS2」のデザイン研究のミーティングが持たれる。とにかく、CPUがくるまでに方向性を決めておきたい。新ちゃんタッチでいくか、BDタッチでいくか、ジョニータッチでいくかを決定したい。僕としてはテクスチャを描き込むのではなく、素材をそのまま使い、ライティングでいかすようなものにしたい。また顔も面で構成し、陰影で凹凸が再現されるようなものにしたい。明らかに今のレンダリングCGとは一線を画すものを目指す。 また風邪がぶり返す。今度はカコナール液を薬局で買って、2本ぐい飲みする。顔色が悪かったのか、レジの兄ちゃんが粉末のビタミンCをくれた。なんだか、心温まる思い。 帰りに定期券を購入する。3ヵ月分なので次は4月10日まで。定期を買うときはいつも切れる時期を想像して、様々な妄想をしてしまう。この時期までに開発はUPしているだろうか、この時期まで会社にいるだろうか、この時期まで生きているだろうか? などなど。 ミネシの机の上にボール・オースターの新刊「偶然の音楽」が置かれていた。 「これ、どうしたん?」と聞くと、「表紙のイラストが気に入ったので買いました」と、いつものひょうひょうとした答え。「面白かった?」と訪ねると。「読んでません」と答える。なんと、彼は表紙欲しさに単行本を買って、それを読まずに飾っているのか? ポールよ、悲しすぎるではないか? 「ユリイカ」の1月号、ポール・オースターの特集号を読むが、アメリカ現代文学に対する知識が全くないため、ほとんど何が書いてあるのかわからない状態。自分がとんでもないアホに思える。""","1999-01-11 (Monday) Today, I worked on my manuscript for Game Critique titled ""Snake Eyes and De Palma."" It’s been several weeks since I saw the movie, so I don’t remember much about it. Well, I did watch it a second time on a plane around the end of the year, so maybe it’s not that bad. Still, forgetting what I originally wanted to write about is frustrating, to say the least. In the end, I couldn’t write a very good manuscript to kick off this year. It’s hard to call it a good start. Yesterday, my son and I both drew ""Double Great Fortune"" at the shrine, but perhaps it’s not as reliable as I thought. Or maybe it’s a bad omen after all. I had planned to scrap the ""Old Man"" character, but this morning, Hirano-kun brought me some settings and reference materials. The content is so dense that I can’t use it as-is, but there are some interesting parts. The idea of having him attack with two young girls (Valkyries) is ethically impossible. Could ""Old Man"" make a comeback? Shin-chan came to the office for the first time this year. Come on, Yoji Shinkawa, get in better shape!!! I handed over the draft and character settings for MGS2. Z.O.E is on hold for now. I asked them to compile the rough sketches we’ve done so far into a file. We held a design research meeting for MGS2, with Mizupin at the center. We want to decide on the direction before the CPU arrives. We need to settle on whether to go with Shin-chan’s style, BD’s style, or Johnny’s style. Personally, I don’t want to rely on hand-drawn textures. I’d prefer to use raw materials and emphasize the lighting to bring them to life. I also want the faces to be composed of flat surfaces, where shadows and lighting recreate the sense of depth and contours. I’m aiming for something that clearly sets itself apart from the current standard of CG rendering. The cold came back again. This time, I bought two bottles of Kakkonol liquid from the pharmacy and chugged them. I must have looked unwell because the guy at the register gave me some powdered vitamin C. It warmed my heart, somehow. On the way home, I bought a commuter pass. It’s for three months, so it’s good until April 10. Whenever I buy a pass, I imagine the time when it expires and fantasize about all sorts of things: Will the development be finished by then? Will I still be with the company? Will I even still be alive by then? There was a copy of Paul Auster's new book The Music of Chance on Mineshi's desk. I asked, ""How did you get this?"" to which he casually replied, ""I bought it because I liked the cover illustration."" When I asked, ""Was it good?"" he said, ""I haven’t read it."" What? Did he really buy a hardcover book just for the cover and then not read it? Paul, you deserve better than this... I read the January issue of Eureka, the special issue on Paul Auster, but since I have no knowledge of contemporary American literature, I could barely understand anything. I felt like a total idiot.","99/1/11 (Monday) Today I wrote a contribution for Game Criticism, “Snake Eyes and De Palma”. It had already been a few weeks since I saw the movie, so I didn’t remember what happened very well. Well, I saw it a 2nd time on a plane around the end of the year, so it wasn’t so bad. There’s nothing worse than when you forget what you were about to write. Ultimately, I haven’t been able to write any good contributions since the first one this year. Hardly a sign of good things to come. Maybe that fortune I pulled with my son yesterday for “double excellent luck for parent and child”, wasn’t all that credible after all. Could be a bad omen. As for Old Man, who I’ve been thinking of scrapping, Hirano brought me reference materials for his setting this morning. The contents are quite dense, so I can’t really use them as is, but there were some interesting parts. Bringing along 2 girls when doing an attack (Valkyries) is probably impossible ethically. Maybe I bring back Old Man? Shin chan came back to work for the first time this year. I’m counting on you Yoji Shinkawa, discipline your body a bit harder!! Handed over the MGS2 drafts and character settings. Held off with the Z.O.E. stuff. Had all the rough drafts so far collected in a file. Had a meeting with Mizupin at the center on researching the designs for MGS2. At any rate, I want to decide on the direction before the CPU comes. I want to decide if we’re going with Shin-chan’s touch, BD’s touch, or Johnny’s touch. I don’t want it to be drawing textures in detail, but using the materials as is and making use of lighting. Also, I want to make the faces flat then use shading to add in depth. I’m aiming for something that’s an obvious departure from current CG rendering. My cold came back. Bought some kakonaru at the pharmacy and took 2. My face had a bad color to it, so the guy at the register gave me some powdered vitamin C. How thoughtful. Bought a rail pass on the way home. It’s good for 3 months, so up until 4/10. Whenever I buy these passes, I always envision the expiration date and imagine what will be happening around then. Will development be done by then, will I still be at the company, will I still be alive? Things like that. Mineshi had a copy of Paul Auster’s latest book “The Music of Chance” on his desk. When I asked what was up with that, he said, easygoing as ever, that he bought it because he like the illustration on the cover. When I asked if it was interesting, he said he hadn’t read it. So he just wanted the cover and bought it for decoration without reading it? Won’t Paul be upset?

Matsuka is organizing the weapons and equipment based on the notes from the training camp. It seems like Shin-chan's character designs are progressing well. Today, he was drawing Fortune. I don’t think there’s much to worry about. I asked Kume-chan to buy Half-Life for reference for MGS2, since it was selected as Game of the Year by EDGE. While the graphics are somewhat underwhelming, the gameplay and attention to detail are astounding. Once again, I felt that sense of ""We’ve been outdone by the Americans!"" Most of all, the atmosphere is incredible. The real-time direction is superb, and you can feel the soul of the creators in the game. The sequence where dimensions shift during the lab accident gave me goosebumps. Japanese blockbuster games lack this kind of soul. While it's not an especially groundbreaking game, its careful attention to detail, direction, and mechanics is more than enough to build a compelling game world. Everything in the game can be destroyed, bullet holes appear, and when you throw wooden crates or barrels into the river, they float. Even the demo emphasizes freedom, and it feels like an interactive version of MGS's polygon demo! However, this method wouldn’t work for a story-heavy game like MGS. Also, Half-Life has a training mode called ""Hazard Course."" This was originally introduced by Tomb Raider, but it seems to have become standard in modern PC games. I had been thinking about removing VR mode from MGS2, but now I’m reconsidering. I went swimming at the sports club. Since I’m still recovering from my cold, I did five laps and then got out.

I felt like “I’d been outdone by the Americans!” More than anything else, it’s got atmosphere to it, exquisite real time animations, and you can really feel the creator’s soul in the game. The scene with the accident in the lab gave me goosebumps. Major Japanese games don’t have this kind of soul. While not a strikingly innovative game, its attention to detail, animation, and gimmicks are more than enough to carry the gaming world. There are breakable objects, bullet holes left, and when you drop a crate or drum into the river it floats. Even the cutscenes give a refined level of freedom, and if I were to make MGS cutscenes interactive, this is what I’d point to. But this technique won’t work for a game as story centric as MGS. Half Life also has a hazard course training mode. It’s a mode that originally started with Tomb Raider, but now it’s apparently become mostly standard on PC.

This will probably be something we could patent. How can we overcome the non-interactive downtime in polygon demos? This has always been the biggest barrier and problem when trying to merge gameplay with story. In a complex narrative structure like MGS2, the real-time method used in Half-Life would cause the story to be lost on the user. That’s when I came up with today’s idea: the split-screen polygon demo. At certain points in the game, the screen would be split. On one side, the traditional polygon demo plays out, and on the other, the game continues as normal. The split could be either horizontal or vertical, depending on the scene. This method would be perfect for simultaneous events or background developments, such as the classic ""Meanwhile, elsewhere..."" moments where the protagonist isn’t involved. For example, in a scene where three people are disarming bombs at the same time, this would massively increase the tension. The story would unfold on-screen while the gameplay continues, creating freedom and allowing the player to see the narrative. Maybe watching Snake Eyes really paid off. I changed the setting of the old security guard character. Since the other characters are quite complex, I’m going to make him much more straightforward. Instead of being a former terrorist, he’ll be a former NYPD bomb disposal advisor, a desk worker. He’s not a terrorist, but a man who, after more than a decade on the job, made a mistake while disarming a bomb, which led to his retirement. I’ll base this character on Ed from Policenauts. I also want to see Iizuka-san. After a long time, I resumed experiments on the P4 system today. This time, it’s character experiments. We’re testing toon shading-like rendering on real hardware. The idea is to treat areas under a certain light threshold as shadows, filled in with flat shading. In practice, we’re drawing the model twice, which requires double the calculations. The goal is to achieve the texture and feel of anime cels. Ultimately, we’re aiming for a touch like BD’s or the style of Shinkawa’s illustrations. In the first test, I rendered Mei Ling, but depending on the angle, it looks quite harsh. However, the legs look very close to a cel-like appearance, likely because the texture on them is quite flat. For the lit areas, I’m applying smooth shading. In the current state, I added an additional layer for highlights. The brightest areas are flat-filled with white, and alpha blending is applied. Next, I’ll use two stages of shadows and shift them slightly. This gives a kind of blurry effect. Anti-aliasing would normally fix this, but with the current approach, it can’t be applied. Overall, it’s not bad for the first day. But even so, this method is consuming three times the processing power of normal polygon rendering. I wonder what will happen once we add split-screen, shadow processing, and real-time shading on top of this...","99/1/13 (Wednesday) Another industry first, another new system is born! This one must be patented. I’d been bothered up until now on how to overcome the non-interactive time with polygonal cutscenes. This was the biggest obstacle and problem in the fusion of game and story. In the case of MGS2, which has a complex story structure, ""the real-time method of Half-Life' would not convey the plot to the player. So, today I came up with the idea of a split-screen polygon cutscene. At some point during the game, the screen will split, with one screen representing the traditional polygon cutscene and the other screen continuing the game as before. The split can be up and down or left and right as needed. This method of separation can be used to explain all the simultaneous events and foreshadowing that the main character isn’t present to see, like “……meanwhile at X place….”. Especially in bomb demolition scenes where three people are involved at the same time, the sense of realism is sure to skyrocket with the use of this method. It is also flexible and can be used to show the story by displaying it on the screen. Maybe it was a good thing I went and saw “Snake Eyes.” Changed the background for the old soldier. There are already other hard to understand characters, so I’ll make him fairly straightforward. Cancel the ex-terrorist angle and make him a desk-bound guy who used to be a bomb disposal advisor for the N.PD. He wasn’t a terrorist, but made a mistake in dismantling a bomb more than a decade ago, and retired because of it. I’ll make this character Ed from Policenauts. Especially since I want to see Iizuka kin (Shozo Iizuka). For the first time in a while, got back to testing on P4. Today was character testing. The idea is to render a toon shading-like rendering on the actual console. The light source is painted in solid color below a certain value as a shadow. In reality, the model is actually drawn twice, so twice as many calculations are required. The goal is to achieve a texture similar to that of an animation cell, and ultimately, aim for something like BD or Shinkawa’s illustrations. The first try was with Mei-Ling, but things looked quite rough depending on the angle. However, we succeeded in making the legs and other parts of the body look very cellular. This is probably because the texture of the legs is quite flat. Smooth shading is applied to the lighted areas. Now we try layering more highlights. The highlight areas are painted solid white and alpha blended. Next, we put the shadows in at the 2nd stage and shifted the area slightly to show them off. It gave off kind of a blurred effect. I suppose we could have applied anti-aliasing, but it doesn’t look like it would work with this approach. It was just so-so, but it's only the first day. However, even that took three times as much processing as a normal polygon display. What will happen if we add screen division, shadow processing, real-time shading, etc…..","""ポリゴンデモ"" (polygon demo) likely refers to in-game, real-time rendered cutscenes","",""

The name? ""Real-Time Revelation"" system. In MGS2's grand finale, the entire sequence where secrets are revealed will be portrayed in real-time, with characters pointing guns at each other the whole time. It’s the kind of tense situation we’ve seen in Quentin Tarantino or Ringo Lam movies, where more than three characters are all pointing guns at each other, unable to move. In MGS2, the characters constantly switch sides. So, while they have guns aimed at each other, the revelations keep coming, new characters join the scene, and each time the story takes a dramatic twist, the characters shift who they are pointing their guns at. For example, a new character might say, ""Snake was actually the enemy..."" and everyone changes where they’re aiming. Then Snake says, ""No, I was only pretending to be the enemy. It was all Solidus's plan..."" and the targets shift again. Solidus, Ocelot, Snake, Raiden, Fortune, and Sergei will all have their guns pointed at different people as the truth keeps changing. This will happen in real time. The player holds down the weapon button (to keep the gun aimed) while watching the events unfold. Once you aim your gun, you can't release the button until the end. During this time, you can change your target or adjust the camera angle in first-person mode. Flashbacks will be shown in split-screen. Let’s see how this all works out. To destroy the artificial intelligence of Arsenal (the Patriots), FOXDIE will be used again. Emma’s PAL code is hidden in the rhythm of her heartbeat. When her heart stops, the PAL will be input. Ocelot extracts this information from Emma using a truth serum, which is why he intentionally lets her escape. The production and shipment numbers for MGS are as follows: 756,000 units in Japan, 1.38 million units in America, and 770,000 units in Europe (only in the UK, Germany, and France). We’re still shy of reaching 3 million. I stopped by a CD store with Muraoka-san and bought OMD’s greatest hits. I remember that at one point, we had planned to use OMD’s hit song ""Enola Gay"" as the ending theme for the previous game. I also remember Muraoka-san stopping me, saying, ""No one from the younger generation knows such an obscure song."" This morning, I listened to the Bee Gees' greatest hits for the first time in a while, and I almost cried. I guess I’ve reached that age. Maybe I’ll buy Billy Joel’s greatest hits next.","99/1/20 (Wednesday) Another industry first. The name is also an industry first: the ""real-time reveal"" system. This system is an attempt to present the grand finale of MGS2 in real time, with all the reveal sequences taking place with the guns pointed at each other. In MGS2, which uses a tense situation familiar from Tarantino and Ringo Lam's films in which three or more characters all have their guns pointed at each other, no one able to move, the characters are in a state of flux. Essentially, things are revealed as they keep their guns pointed at each other, new characters join in, and people change who they’re pointing their guns at. A new character reveals that “Snake was actually an enemy…”, leading them to change who they’re aiming at. Then Snake says, “you’ve got the wrong guy. I (Snake) was made to look like the enemy. It’s all a ploy by Solidus…” leading everyone to change sides again. Things go back and forth between Solidus, Ocelot, Snake, Raiden, Fortune, and Sergey, with it shifting who each one is pointing their gun at (their number 1 enemy). I want to do that in real time. The player keeps the weapon button pressed (with their gun pointed) and watches the game unfold. Once the player holds the gun, he/she cannot release the button until the end of the game. During this time, the player can change where they point their gun or adjust the prospective angle of attack. Flashback scenes would be done in split-screen mode. I wonder how it will turn out. Will use FOXDIE again to disintegrate the Artificial Intelligence (Patriots) within the Arsenal. Emma's PAL code will be cloaked by her heartbeat. Make it so the PAL can be input when her heart stops beating. Ocelot would use truth serum to get this information from Emma. This is why he intentionally lets Emma go. Production shipments of MGS: 756,000 units in Japan, 1.38 million in America, 770,000 in Europe (just UK, Germany, France). Still short of the 3 million mark. I dropped by a CD shop with Muraoka and bought the best of OMD. In fact, we had originally planned to use OMD's hit song ""Enola Gay"" as the ending song of the last game. I remember Muraoka stopped me, saying, ""none of the kids these days know about such an obscure song.” This morning, I listened to the best of the Beegees for the first time in a while, and it almost brought tears to my eyes.

Its volume is substantial, but what really stands out is the intricate mechanics and the insane, typically American ideas that shine through. In the scene I watched today, you can equip a biological weapon that’s a gun in the shape of a creature, or use a bug-like biological bomb (which looks like an alien bug itself) directly as a weapon. While it’s effective against enemies, if you’re not careful, it can harm the player as well. The motion when holding this biological bomb is also fantastic. It’s not just about having fun; it’s a practical and thoughtful design that you don’t often see in Japanese games. This is a good game, especially as far as Western games go. It seems that, by global standards, the volume of MGS2 must surpass that of the previous game. The current plan is already quite ambitious in terms of volume. However, with this being for a new platform, the release date has been set from the start, making it difficult to balance volume and the development timeline. I’m considering introducing mission selection in the middle of the game, allowing for branching paths. Should Snake and Raiden progress simultaneously, or should the player randomly choose which mission to pursue? Instead of a traditional selection, the player would decide in real-time which mission to go for. The other mission would be handled automatically by Snake. I’ve decided to change the name of ""Old Man"" to ""Old Boy."" The term ""Old Boy"" not only refers to a cunning old man but apparently also has connotations of the devil.

It has quite impressive depth to it, but it is the gimmicky details and the crazy American ideas that make it so appealing. In the scene I saw today, a bioweapon gun can be attached to one hand, and an insect-shaped (insect-shaped alien itself) bio-bomb can be used as a weapon. It is effective against enemies, but if you are not careful, it will harm the player. The animation of holding the bio-bomb is cool too. It is not so much I have fun with it as it is I have respect for the good sense of the game. There aren’t really Japanese games like this. It’s a good game. Especially as a Western game. Somehow, even by current global standards, the volume of MGS2 needs to be greater than that of its predecessor. The current plan is quite rich in volume. This time, however, the deadline for the release date has been set from the beginning, even more so than with the new hardware. It is difficult to find a balance between volume and production time. Will make it possible to select the missions that must be completed mid-game and make them diverge. Snake and Raiden will run concurrently. I don't really want to do this, but there’s no denying that it is a trend in today's game market. Instead of a choice, the player decides which mission to go on in real time.

Having branching scenarios during missions is great, but if the player can see too clearly that the developers are trying to make them replay the game, it’s game over. We need to be careful not to overdo it. It turns out Johnny had tested out the cel-shaded texture model on actual hardware while I was on my business trip. When I asked him how it went, it seems it didn’t work out. Unless we remake the models with a much higher polygon count, it won’t look good. He doesn’t seem confident in it. We might remove it as an option. We’ll try creating a new Vamp model and give it another go. Real-time toon shading is something no one else has tried yet, but I’m convinced it will become a standard technique soon. However, if we continue on this path and another company releases the same visual style before we do, it’s all over. We need a visual approach that doesn’t rely on such tricks. We must stay one step ahead of others. Shin-chan has finalized Raiden’s color scheme. For some reason, it’s starting to resemble Amano-san’s style. Shin-chan’s drawing skills have improved significantly compared to when he first joined the company. However, there’s now a sense of trying too hard to be liked or to draw well, and the raw energy he had as a newcomer is no longer present in his work. What I expect from him is not a polished drawing, but his unique ideas and sense of style. I want him to remember the time when he used to doodle Pantsman.

A plot that branches off in the middle is a good thing, but if it becomes obvious that it’s only there because the creator wants you to play twice, then it’s all over. Must be careful not to overdo it. It turned out that Johnny had been working on an animated cell-like texture models on the actual console while I was on that business trip. When I went to ask him what he thought of them, he said they were no good. The models would have to be redesigned with more polygons to make them look good. Things aren’t looking promising, It doesn’t feel like this will succeed. We may have to remove it from the list of options. Will try again with a new vamp model. I am not sure if anyone has tried real-time toon shading yet, but I am confident that it will be a common process in the near future. I am personally convinced that this process will become commonplace in the future. Even if things continue progressing, at this rate, other companies may do the same thing before we release, and if that happens it’s all over. We still need a new visual approach that isn’t just some cheap trick. We need to stay a step ahead of everyone else. Shin-chan is finishing up color images of Raiden. For some reason, they are starting to look like Amano’s style. Shin-chan's drawings have become much better than when he first started working here. However, looking closely, while he does have artistic skill, his pictures don’t give off the same vigor as the ones he did as a newcomer. What I am looking for from him is not a but his unique ideas and style. I remember when he drew a doodle of Captain Underpants. Will be traveling to Europe from March 5th through to the 10th. Plan to go around London and Frankfurt. Currently, 950,000 units sold. U.S. sales are at 1,470,000. Dirty White Boys was interesting. Stephen Hunter is a great man.

I had Sonoyama-kun start testing first-person attacks using the PlayStation system. It’s pretty interesting, but it inevitably slows down the game’s sense of speed. Run, stop, aim, shoot—this becomes the basic gameplay loop in MGS2. The overall feel is slightly different. The key challenge is maintaining the right tempo. How much of an advantage—or disadvantage—will first-person attacks give the player? The effect of the FAMAS tracer rounds was unexpectedly good. In 3D, it’s hard to see the bullet trajectory, but with tracer rounds, it becomes very clear. I realized this is probably how they’re used in real life, too. I discussed with Muraoka-san whether to use Billy Joel’s ""New York State of Mind"" or Frank Sinatra’s ""New York, New York"" for the opening and ending. After all, the keyword is ""New York.""

It changes the visuals slightly. The problem is how to set the tempo. Also, how much of an advantage will 1st person mode be to the player? Or will it be a disadvantage? I didn’t expect the FA-MAS tracers to be effective. It is difficult to see bullet trajectory in 3D, but using tracers made it incredibly easy to follow.

The hit detection, bleeding, and death rate settings I established for the enemy soldiers turned out to be fairly accurate in comparison to reality. Hirano-kun brought me copies of back issues of Military Research. They contained data on the injury rates of U.S. soldiers in various body parts during the Vietnam War and the mortality rates caused by those injuries.

Processing codec conversations in real-time would increase immersion, but it could also cause a lot of stress. If we aren’t careful, players might stop using the codec altogether. To prioritize the situation of the surrounding enemy soldiers during codec calls, we decided to display the face of the person the player is communicating with. I asked the staff about the idea of not showing Rosemary’s face during codec calls. Instead, we would rely solely on Kikuko Inoue’s voice to let users imagine what she looks like. This would allow each player to project their ideal version of Rosemary. The concept would be that during the final cutscene, we’d reveal a model of the player’s ideal woman based on their preferences throughout the game. Throughout the game, we would subtly ask the player about their tastes, and the ending would reflect that. However, if we do this, the character might not stand out as much. There’s also a concern that if we don’t show her face early on, the player might lack motivation. At Korepy’s desk, I tested the hit detection for different body parts. In first-person view, I shot the enemy soldier’s arms and legs, rendering them into a ""Daruma"" (a figure without arms or legs). Since the enemy couldn’t move, they just squirmed on the ground.

I asked around the staff about how if we are going to stop displaying faces on the radios, how about not showing Rosemary's face? We would ask players to just imagine Rosemary with only Kikuko Inoue's voice. They could imagine her as whatever type they prefer. The plan is to have a model of the player's ideal woman appear in the last cutscene. The player’s preferences would be asked throughout the game and then reflected in the end. However, the character won’t stand out if we do this. Also, if her visuals are not presented at the beginning of the game, there’s a risk that players will be less motivated.

I explained the details regarding focus and aperture to the programmers, but I’m doubtful whether it can be implemented. For first-person aiming, we’ve added zoom when the gun is raised, but it makes the hands disappear from view, so we’ll need to use some visual trickery. We’ll need to apply arms of different scales when in first-person mode. This will increase the workload since we’ll need separate models, skeleton structures, and animations.

Did voice recording for the giant monster Genola for the VR disc. I went to Muraoka's usual booth (in SD). My throat wasn’t feeling good today for some reason. So ultimately, Mccammon and I split the recording duties. Dodongo, Alien Baltan, Deabolica, Zetton, Dada, Finger Gelge, all made for inspiration. My throat hurt even more. I left the rest to McCammon. Matsuhana and Shin-chan went to Shinjuku to buy materials. Plastic models of deep-sea exploration diving suits for deep-sea exploration, and a Harrier (alternatively a Sea Harrier) and a book about ships. They didn’t have the old Stephen Hunter books I had asked for. They asked the store to order the plastic model tanker for me. Imai is still making plastic models of tankers for overseas. Apparently they have a ""tanker series"". Hirano immediately peeked through the book about ships and made some strange noises. Bought a new book by Jeffrey Archer. Got an e-mail from Mori. (Mori Motosada) He’s a US SOCOM anti-terrorism instructor, and a former Green Beret who was impressed by MGS. He wants to help with the next one. Matsuhana will start taking video for the weekend meeting, using a digicam recording of the pocket station to explain the FOXDIE project.

I was supposed to meet Hattori-san at Hamamatsucho station (at the ticket gate). However, even when the time came, she hadn’t shown up. Shinchyan and I were waiting at the exit closer to Warner, which was exposed to the elements, and it was unbearably cold. On top of that, it was raining. It turns out Hattori-san was waiting at the monorail side of the station gate. If only we had realized earlier... I may have caught a cold. Lately, I seem to be one step behind in everything I do. We had lunch at a restaurant in the station building. Once inside, it was filled with old men—salarymen to the left and right. Looking at the lunch menu, the ""Steak Set,"" limited to 50 servings, caught my eye. Surprisingly, it came with soup and salad for only 800 yen! Cheap, like Osaka. And to top it off, it came with dessert for women! Hamamatsucho is quite an amazing place. Since the rain was getting worse, we took a taxi to Warner. The Negotiator was pretty interesting. Kevin Spacey had a great presence. But like with Enemy of the State, it’s a tough movie to write about. The trailer for a movie called The Matrix played at the beginning, and it was insanely cool. It looked like a superhero film with a comic book vibe. The main character was Keanu. He was running along the walls. It reminded me of the ""Chinaman"" in MGS2. On the way back, I stopped by a CD shop to reserve the Dango San Kyoudai CD. As I was about to say ""Dango..."" to the staff, I spotted a flyer for the reservation campaign right in front of me. ""I’d like to reserve this,"" I quickly said, pointing to the flyer. The clerk immediately prepared the reservation form, asking, ""The CD single, right?"" I was relieved it went smoothly.

Hattori was waiting at the ticket gate on the monorail side. I should have realized it earlier....... I might have caught a cold. I've been too slow in everything I do these days. Had lunch at a restaurant in the station building. When I entered the restaurant, I saw only fathers. Businessmen right and left. Looking at the lunch menu, the steak set caught my eye.

It was raining hard, so we took a cab to Warner Brothers. The Negotiator was pretty interesting. Kevin Spacey really elevated it. However, as with Enemy, it was difficult to write any commentary on.

We’re already far behind the original plan. I saw some photos of Syphon Filter, which was released overseas. It seems like it might have first-person aiming. In the afternoon, I headed to the Tokyo International Forum. I got off at Yurakucho and went straight to the hall. It looked like another event was happening, but thanks to the stylish design of the SCE signs, I didn’t get lost. Once inside, I noticed lots of foreigners and reporters. I handed over my invitation at the counter and went in. As expected, there were many foreigners—more than half of the attendees were non-Japanese. Everyone was wearing earpieces for translations. At 2 p.m., the ""PlayStation Meeting 1999"" began. A female announcer acted as the host, and a 5-minute montage of PlayStation’s five-year history played. It showcased the 50 million units sold and the titles and events from the past. There was even a brief glimpse of MGS with three cuts of footage from 1998. Unfortunately, MGS was the only Konami title featured. After a greeting from Tokunaka, the President of SCE (at the time), Kutaragi took the stage to talk about the next-generation PlayStation. His presentation was especially energetic today. He explained the hardware specs and the concept of the ""Emotion Engine."" Then, he demonstrated using visuals. Most of the footage was the same as what I saw at SCE headquarters back in November, but Penguin Panic caught me off guard. It had a bigger impact than the ""500-Snake"" demo. It seems like the idea of ""hordes"" is something everyone is reaching for. Next, Okamoto took over to explain the development environment. He was pretty nervous and stiff. Then Kutaragi returned to introduce the main event of the day. Tanaka from the technical team took the stage and introduced the various experiment teams. First up was SCE. Yamauchi from Gran Turismo presented. They showed a Gran Turismo demo where they rendered pre-rendered CPU footage on the actual hardware. Then, there was a game demo where they drove shiny, medium-polygon cars on the same Gran Turismo background course. Next was FromSoftware. They showed dozens of skeletons writhing against a dark castle wall, repeating motions. The developer moved a fairy (with phosphorescent particles) and when it hit the skeletons, they crumbled. Namco followed, displaying a model from Tekken, building a background (with streetlights and steam), and showing around 30 spectators. The game was playable, and the level of completion was high. Finally, Square demonstrated the famous old man’s face from the Final Fantasy movie. They showed off facial animation and lighting movements. The model had 100,000 polygons! The last demo was Final Fantasy VIII. It was a dance scene, limited to just two characters, but it was well done. The facial expressions, hair, and clothing movements were the most impressive part of today’s demos. I think Kutaragi’s message that ""previous cinematic scenes will now run on the actual hardware!"" got through. The biggest announcement today, though, was that ""PS2 will be fully backward compatible with PS1!"" The audience burst into applause and cheers. On the way back, I managed to snag the Dango San Kyoudai CD. The store had a ""sold out"" sign posted already. When I got home and checked the evening paper, it said the first run was 100,000 copies.","99/3/2 (Tuesday) In the morning, I prepare a schedule outline and staff list for MGS2. It is already far behind the original schedule. Looked at some pictures of Syphon Filter, which is about to be released overseas. Looks like it might have 1st person shooting. Just past noon, I headed to the Tokyo International Forum. I got off at Yurakucho and went straight to the hall. There seemed to be some other events going on, but thanks to SCE's stylishly designed signage, I didn't get lost. As I entered the hall, I noticed a lot of foreigners and the press. I handed over my invitation letter at the counter and went inside. There really were a lot of foreigners. More than half of the people there were foreigners. They were all wearing translation earphones. At 2:00 p.m., the ""PlayStation Meeting 1999"" began. A female announcer appeared as the hostess, and a 5-minute video rushing through the 5-year history of the PS was shown. The project looks back at the 50 million units sold, what titles were released, and events that took place over the five years. Three cuts of MGS were shown as part of 1998. Unfortunately MGS was Konami’s only representation. After greetings by then SCE President Tokunaka, Kutaragi appeared on stage. He talked about the next generation PlayStation. His presentation was even better than usual. He was so energetic. After explaining the hardware specs and concept (Emotion Engine?), he explained some more while showing images. Mostly cutscenes that were shown at SCE headquarters in November. But Penguin Panic got me, it was more impactful than 500 Snakes. Uh oh. The idea of a ""swarm"" seems to be something everyone’s come up with. After that, he passed the baton to Okamoto. He explained the development environment. Okamoto was very nervous and stiff. Then, Kutaragi appeared again. Today's main event. Tanaka, the technical director, appeared and introduced the experimental teams in order. First up was SCE. Yamauchi from GT gave a presentation. He showed us GT, images rendered in advance by the CPU and played back on the actual console, much like what we’ve also been working on. Next was the game. A shiny car moved on top of the middle polygon background GT course. Next was From Software. Dozens of skeletons were wriggling against the backdrop of dark castle walls. Repeated animation. When the developer moved a fairy (phosphorescent particles) and it hit a skeleton, the skeleton crumbled. Namco. The Tekken models were displayed as is, with polished backgrounds (city lights and steam) and about 30 onlookers. Then they showed actual gameplay. It was quite close to completion. Finally, Square. They had footage of the face of that one famous old man from FF. They demonstrated the facial animation and lighting movements. The model was 100,000 polygons! Last was FFVIII. A dancing scene. It was limited to 2 characters. but it was very well done. The facial expressions, the hair on their heads, the swaying of their clothes, etc., were the most impressive part. The movie scenes up to this point are moving on the actual machine. Kutaragi got his point across when he said that, “these cutscenes are running on the actual console!” The most impactful part of today's demonstration was the announcement that ""PS2 is fully compatible with PS!” The audience applauded and cheered. On the way home, I got that copy of ""Dango 3 Kyodai”. They already had a paper posted saying “sorry, sold out.” After returning home, I found out in the evening paper it had sold its first 100,000 copies.","","",""

At Takabe-kun’s desk, around 20 Vamp characters were being displayed. With over a hundred characters rendered on-screen, it’s really starting to lag. Incredible! My cough still hasn’t stopped, so I visit the doctor. A student-looking doctor says, “If that medicine didn’t work, then that’s not good…” Not the same mini-skirt-wearing doctor as last time. They couldn’t do much, so they just gave me an inhaler. No improvement. I noticed the side effects listed for my prescribed medication include ""akushin"" (悪心). I looked it up, and it literally means ""an evil heart with malicious intent."" Is it even safe to take medicine that causes such a side effect? If I commit a crime after taking this, would I still be held accountable? The prescription reads: ""Codeine phosphate 100x powder"" Cough suppressant Side effects: nausea, drowsiness, constipation, dizziness Please be cautious when performing dangerous tasks like operating a vehicle."" During lunch, I head to the bookstore and buy the second volume of Brandenburg no Seiyaku (Brandenburg's Oath). In the new releases section, Battle Royale is stacked high. Seems to be selling well. The ad copy on the book is intense: ""Lost the Horror Grand Prize!"" You’d expect them to advertise it as a winner, but it’s the first time I’ve seen a book promoted for losing. In the evening, I head to Radio Nippon to appear on a show hosted by Kuroda-san. There’s no preparation done in advance. During the recording, as expected, I keep coughing, but they said it’s not a problem! Kuroda and the other host kept smoking like chimneys, which made it tough for me.

We set them up one by one, starting with Okaji (Okamura). At Takabe's station, about 20 vamps were displayed. It only starts to lag when you have over a hundred people on the screen. I was astonished!!! Today, I went to the doctor because I was still coughing. The doctor, who looked like a student, said, ""it's bad if that medicine doesn't work...."" It was a different doctor from the one in the miniskirt last time. There was nothing they could do, so I just got some inhalations done. My symptoms remained the same. But the side effect of the medicine I was prescribed had a warning labeled ""悪心” (malicious motive) on it. The dictionary says that ""malicious motive"" is ""a mind that is bent on doing evil”. I don't think it's right to administer a drug that causes such side effects! I wonder if I will not be convicted if I commit any crimes after taking this drug.

The second day of Mouri-san's special seminar. We started with the homework: the airplane infiltration. I thought there would be around 32 people, but I was shocked to hear there were actually more than 60. Today, we moved from yesterday's dynamic entry to stealth entry, which is the main focus. Unlike before, this time, 'we don’t know where the enemy is,' so we meticulously clear the area, taking our time without making any noise. The slower movement makes it much harder than dynamic entry. We each practiced corner clearing one by one. When I tried to perform the 'peeking' move from a secret video Mouri-san showed me two years ago, he scolded me. Apparently, that’s not the right way to move, but since it looks good in motion, I might keep it in the game. Next, we moved on to T-junctions, varying the scenarios for two people, three people, and larger groups. Things got more and more confusing... Then, we used the seminar room, support room, and VIP room to train stealth entries. We placed terrorists inside and ran the drills. For the Matsubana team, I played the role of a villain. I turned off the lights, set up a chair in front of the door so it wouldn’t fully open, and waited in ambush. As expected, Matsubana was so focused on the back of the door that they didn’t notice I was aiming from the opposite side. I waited about five seconds, but since they didn’t notice, I shot to kill. Honestly, if the enemy knows the terrain and how you’re going to attack, there’s no chance of winning. I also fell into Mouri-san’s trap—the door was intentionally left open, and two enemies were chatting inside. I got distracted by them, and another person ambushed me from the shadows in the hallway. When special forces who are familiar with every tactic become the enemy, it’s a serious problem. Defending is overwhelmingly easier than attacking. We watched footage of Collevy’s clearing (on PlayStation). While it’s not exactly the same as real-life tactics, it’s not far off. With some fine-tuning, it could work. If we use tools like the 'small window system,' mirrors, and ropes well, I think the game could effectively convey the clearing process to the user. The key is that, in real life, clearing is thorough, but that wouldn’t translate into fun gameplay. It’s all about how to capture the atmosphere. The tools, motions, and pathfinding will be critical. Mouri-san showed me a TV program about an offshore plant that aired on cable TV. It was a valuable resource. For some reason, Mark Hamill was narrating it. In the evening, I went to Jiyugaoka to see Horrors of Malformed Men (late show) with the unusual group of Muraoka-san, Shin-chan, and Kirioka-san. It was a great theater. The movie was surprising, but the final scene’s direction was astonishing! I laughed so much my cough came back. It's amazing to think that this film was made in the same year as 2001: A Space Odyssey.""","-99/6/17 (Thursday) Yesterday's lecture was so interesting that I added a few more people to the seminar room. 8 people, mainly designers. Day 2 of Mori's special discussion. First, we started with the homework airplane raid. I thought there would be at most 32 people, but was surprised to hear that there were actually more than 60. Today, we started from yesterday's direct entry then moved onto stealth entry, which is also the main entry. Unlike yesterday, we were in a situation where we did not know where the enemies were. We took our time and cleared the area thoroughly, without making any noise. The slow movement makes it difficult to move, unlike direct entry. The first step is to clear the corners one by one. When I demonstrated the ""peek-a-boo"" technique that I had seen in a top-secret video shown to me by Mori two years ago, he actually got mad. He said that I shouldn’t move like that. However, it makes for flourishing animation, so I may leave it in the game. Next, he changed the situation to a T junction, in cases of 2, 3, or more people. It got more and more complicated. Then we used the seminar room, reception, pub room, and VIP for stealth entry training. We did with terrorists actually set up inside the rooms. In the case of the Matsuhana’s team, I played the role of the villain. I turned off the lights, placed a chair in front of the door so that it would not open all the way and waited to ambush them. The Matsuhana team was distracted by the back of the door, and was completely unaware of me pointing at them from the other side. They were in full view. I waited for about 5 seconds, but they did not notice, so, I shot them dead. To be honest, I knew the terrain and knew how they were going to attack, so they had no chance. I was also caught in Mori's trap. The door was open, and two enemies inside were chatting with each other inside. I was so distracted by the two that I could not see another person was waiting in the shadows of the passageway. When the enemy is a special forces unit that is familiar with all kinds of operations, it can be a real mess. The defenders had a tremendous advantage over the attackers. Had Korepi show an experimental video of clearing (PS). It is different from the real thing but does not seem to be too far off. It should work with some minor adjustments. In particular, if the ""small window system"" and props such as mirrors and strings are used well, clearing should get across well to the players. Real clearing is done thoroughly, but that doesn’t make for a game. In other words, we want to add in the atmosphere of clearing as much as possible. The main factors are the small tools, the animation, and the course layout. Mori showed me a program on cable TV about an offshore plant. It is very valuable material. For some reason, Mark Hamill narrated the program. Went to Jiyugaoka to see a late show of Horrors of Malformed Men. Was joined by an unusual group of Muraoka, Shin-chan, and Kirioka. It was a nice theater. I was surprised at this movie. The last scene was so great!!! I laughed so hard that my cough came back. It was very moving that this movie was made in the same year as 2001: A Space Odyssey.","Horrors of Malformed Men (恐怖奇形人間): A 1969 Japanese horror film directed by Teruo Ishii,","",""

I checked online, but there’s almost no reaction. In the morning, I went to the museum with Matsubana. I vaguely remember coming here with my son about two years ago, but I don’t recall how much material they had on tankers. Since it was around lunchtime, we looked for a place to eat. The only options were the restaurant inside the museum and a pasta place near the pool, so we walked to the pasta place. When we got inside, we were the only customers. In fact, it felt like we were the first customers of the day! We nervously ate our spaghetti. We toured the museum. As requested by Shin-chan, I went around collecting the two-page information sheets available in each section of the 'Ship Knowledge Collection.' After gathering everything and organizing it into a file, it made a complete book. It took some time, but I finished two complete copies. The tanker materials had a lot of models, but there were no exhibits showing the internal structure. I couldn’t see the hallways and spaces inside the tanker that the staff who went to see one in person had described. However, the slides and videos on 'How a Tanker Is Made' helped me gain a deeper understanding of a tanker’s structure, mechanisms, and purpose. The Q&A quiz on tankers was particularly useful. I’d like to incorporate things like the panel to prevent static electricity into the game. Living for 35 years, I’ve realized how completely ignorant I was about tankers and the people who work with them. I went to the Matrix screening at Shibuya Pantheon. The crowd was huge!

The section on tankers was well filled with scale models. However, there were no exhibits that showed the internal structure. The staff who actually went to see the tanker told us that they couldn’t see below decks or inside. However the slides and videos, on ""how a tanker is made” showed the structure and how it works and greatly deepened my knowledge of the tanker itself.

The theme is 'life' and 'death' in all organisms that evolve through sexual reproduction. The previous game depicted the 'passing on of genes to offspring,' which follows the laws of nature. This time, the focus is on things that cannot be passed down through genetic information alone—soul, thought, history, environment, and how to pass these on to the next generation. Also, why are these important, and why are they not written into genes? These are the central themes. For this reason, I made slight changes to the Old Boy’s character setting. After achieving immortality, he continues an 'endless battle,' but as a being (species) who has lost the significance of passing down genes (after losing his son), he is left with no 'life' or 'death.' His only anchor in this state is the battlefield. This is the same for both Big Boss in the past and Solidus now. In the afternoon, Muranaka-san came to the office. We had a meeting regarding Harry Gregson-Williams. It seems Harry responded positively to the image BGM we sent him (which included selections from The Rock, Crimson Tide, Enemy, and others). He also watched the MGS video we sent and said he 'wanted to play the game,' so he’s very enthusiastic about the project. At 4 p.m., we had a meeting to discuss the schedule and status of MGS2. There’s too much to do. At this rate, we might only be working on the tanker chapter for the rest of the year, and the game might not be completed.

We’ll have to reduce the volume of content, but if we mess this up, MGS could disappear altogether.""","99/7/13 (Tuesday) Revised the themes of MGS2 once again. Sex ""(life)"" and ""death"" in all organisms that evolve through sexual reproduction. The previous game depicted the passing on of genes to offspring according to the laws of nature. The theme of this game is how to pass on to our children those things that cannot be transferred through genetic information, such as souls, thoughts, history, and the environment. On why are these things important, and why they can’t be written into our genes. For that reason, I made slight alterations to Old Boy’s background. Having attained immortality and continuing an “endless battle”, and his reason to live to whom he passed on his genetics having been erased (his son dying), his existence is neither “life” nor “death,” so he turns to the battlefield for meaning. The former Big Boss and Solidus are the same. Nakamura came to work in the afternoon. We had a discussion about Harry Gregson-Williams. He listened to the songs we had selected as examples for our vision for the BGM (excerpts from ""The Rock,"" ""Crimson Tide,"" ""Enemy of the State,"" etc.), and seemed to like them. He was also very enthusiastic about the video of MGS I sent him at the same time, saying that he, “wanted to play it.” At 4:00, had a meeting to discuss the schedule and status of MGS2. There are too many things that need doing. At this rate, I'll spend most of the year working on the tanker arc, and it may not even become a game. Thanks to the excessive “EE” announcements for animations, models, etc., it’s going to be highly over spec'd. Production will be tough. It doesn’t look like we’ll make it on time. If we screw this up it will be the end of MGS.","EE (Emotion Engine): Refers to the PlayStation 2’s CPU, which was heavily marketed for its advanced capabilities, Image BGM (イメージBGM): Refers to reference or sample background music that Kojima sent to Harry Gregson-Williams to give him an idea of the musical tone and atmosphere Kojima had in mind for MGS2.","",""

Toyopi showed me the facial animation they’re experimenting with. The back teeth look a bit scary, but it’s pretty good. If we add textures, it should give a somewhat anime-like facial expression. However, it probably won’t look photorealistic. Watching the mouth movement, I felt like making a character who’s always chewing gum. I’ll give that role to Fatman. At Sonopi’s and Colepy’s places, the bodies are now staying behind. It’s looking good. As the bodies accumulate, it really creates a 'battlefield' atmosphere. Leaving bodies behind makes them much easier to discover than I anticipated. However, since the bodies remain, we’ll need more variations in the death animations. The rain effect is being blended in. It’s coming along nicely. Over at Morita-kun’s, they’ve completed the 'legs-only shadow' effect. We’ll make Raiden’s posture a little straighter. We’ll keep the 'thief-like' concept for his movements. We’ll deal with the issue of his height (camera perspective) being too low in first-person mode later.

Rose, who was originally an office worker at a securities firm, will be kidnapped by the Patriots (the Colonel) and forced to work as the data handler to threaten Raiden. She’ll only communicate via radio, never appearing on-site. Rose will continue calling Raiden by his real name throughout, constantly making him concerned for her safety. Midway through, Raiden realizes he’s missing memories of her. Later, he learns that the Colonel and Doctor are artificial intelligences, and he starts to suspect Rose is too.

Looking at the mouth movements made me want to make a character that chews gum all the time. I'll have Fatman play that role. They got dead bodies to stay behind at Sonopi's (Sonoyama) and Korepi’s station. They look good. When the bodies are left behind, it makes it feel like a battlefield. When the bodies are left behind, it also makes you easier to be discovered than you would think. However, having dead bodies remain makes death animation variations more necessary.

Will continue with the sneaky thief concept as is. The concept of ""this is the situation"" will continue as it is. Will think about the problem with the low camera height in 1st person mode later. On the way back home, I thought about scrapping Johnny and Data as characters. Currently, there are too many characters, and it is not possible to make each of them unique. The strategy is to increase the number of times main characters appear by eliminating supporting characters. Therefore, the role of Johnny will be assigned to Olga. The Colonel introduces Olga, under the name ""Mr. X,"" and at first she’ll be a collaborator (spy). She is on the patriot side. Also changed Rose from being a newscaster, and gave her Data’s role. The patriots (the colonel) abduct Rose, an office worker at a brokerage firm, and force her into the data role in order to intimidate Raiden. Rose isn’t there in person, only on the radio. Rose calls Raiden by his real name until the end and is concerned about his well-being. After the midpoint, Raiden realizes that his memories of her are missing. In the latter half, he learns that ""Colonel"" and ""Doc"" were artificial intelligence, and wonders whether or not Rose is too. This is kind of a return to the original plan. In the end, Rose tells him she is pregnant. Raiden reunites with her and names the child ""Dave”. Raiden was unable to protect Olga's child, something else he carries with him.","","",""

An idea for how Solidus can clear the current President’s ID. In this world, Ocelot has Liquid’s right arm transplanted.

Ocelot has a transplant of Liquid's right arm in the setting. So he tries to transplant the president’s right arm and pass biometrics with his living right arm. This would allow him to fire all U.S. nuclear weapons. Downloaded the Ape Escaper minigame onto my pocket station late at night. It's a game that you mostly just watch, but it is quite interesting.

It ended up being quite a busy summer vacation. I think I got to spend a good amount of time playing with my son. Since I took my summer vacation at a different time, today, Wednesday, was my first day back at the office. As expected, my desk was piled high with letters, summer greeting cards, invoices, and receipts that needed my signature. When I opened my email, it was completely red! And this is just after two days. It was exhausting. I spent the entire morning dealing with all of it, then wrote the project proposal for Ghost Babel. By the time I finished, it was already past 3 p.m. I moved on to refining the plot. As expected, it’s hard to focus with so many people around, unlike on holidays. At Matsubana’s desk, the Tanker scene with rain, clouds, and enemy soldiers was coming together. The small textures are stretched, giving it a bit of an N64 vibe. There’s still a long way to go. As for Raiden, it seems we’ll have to abandon the crouching motion. There’s still the issue with foot placement. With so many layers of vertical structure, the first-person shooting looks like it could be fun. However, the issue is how to handle the sights. I don’t want to use a traditional “+” reticle like in other games. I want to stick to the concept of aiming down the gun’s sights. The whole reason we adopted this gun-view perspective was to aim using the sights. If we’re going to compromise on this, we might as well scrap it. A 35,000 yen plaster statue has arrived at Johnny's desk. The groin is strangely large. It probably won’t last more than a few weeks before breaking. If it helps us get a better model, it’s worth it. We plan to buy one more. By the time development is over, they’ll probably be shattered into pieces. Almost all the programmers are here. The staff who went to the SIGGRAPH conference are back, so it’s lively again. Xin-chan and Toyopy are still on vacation. Morita-kun showed me the water surface effect he made. Apparently, he drew the sea and wave textures himself, and they look really good. He really is a promising programmer. The ability a programmer needs most is to create something surprising with ideas and ingenuity within the given environment. Very few people can do that. It’s not about technique. It’s about ideas backed by technique. At 6:30 p.m., we held a screening of The Greed in the seminar room. I left early to go to the sports club. When I returned, the movie had just finished. At home, I watched Arlington Road. It was interesting. The ending left me with a sense of discomfort, much like when I watched Kurt Russell’s Breakdown. Kyle Cooper’s opening sequence wasn’t much to talk about. The idea was too simple.","99/8/18 (Wednesday) Obon vacation is over. It was quite a busy summer vacation.

I opened my email and saw it stuffed to the brim too!!! All of this in just two days. I'm worn out. I handled it all through the morning and wrote a planning application for Ghost Babel. It was already past 3:00 p.m. Start working on wrapping up the plot. Unlike on holidays, there were a lot of people around, so I got distracted and didn't get much done. Matsuhana’s station was working on the tanker, rain, and enemy soldiers. The small textures were stretched, giving a strong N64-like impression. It still needs work. As for Raiden, no choice but to give up on his stooping animation. There are still problems around his feet. With such a tiered structure of upper and lower levels, 1st person shooting looks fun. However, the question is what to do with the sight. I don't want there to be a ""+"" target like in other games. I want to stick to it truly being 1st person when using the guns. The reason why I originally adopted 1st person was because I wanted to aim at targets with a sight. If we are going to bend the concept, we should just drop it. A 35,000-yen stone statue has arrived at Johnny's seat. It has a micro dick between its legs. There’s no doubt it will break within a few weeks. But, if it helps us make a good model even a little bit, then it’s cheap. We are planning to buy one more. I’ll have them smashed to pieces when development ends. Most of the programmers are here. The ones that went on a business trip to SIGGRAPH are back, so for the first time in a while, things are bustling. Shin-chan and Toyopi are still on break. Morita showed me some sea surface effects. Apparently he made the texture of the sea surface and the waves himself, and it looks incredibly good. I look forward to his future as a programmer. He has that necessary ability in a programmer to create surprises with ideas and ingenuity in a given environment. There are very few people who can do that. It is not about the technology, but the ideas behind the technology. Held a watch party for Deep Rising at 6:30 p.m. in the seminar room. I left at the beginning and went to the sports club. I got back just as it was ending. I went home and watched Arlington Road. It was interesting. The last scene left me feeling uncomfortable, similar to how I felt watching Kurt Russell's Breakdown.

Just before leaving the house, my son called. I’ve revived the previously scrapped ""stealth camera."" I think it has more novelty and impact than the remote missile. It will play an important role in the Emma rescue and boss fights. It’s fun, but the difficulty is extremely high. I have a feeling it might get scrapped at the very last minute. I’ve decided to include the giant shark event after all. It’s such a classic to have a shark in something involving the ocean, but that's exactly why I want to put it in. Next month, Renny Harlin’s new film Deep Blue Sea is also being released. Shadows casting similar to those in Zelda have been implemented on the Tanker. The current issue with the jittering is due to the models not being properly divided, which is causing inefficiencies. Once the model splitting is addressed, the background rendering will be significantly faster. Since first-person shooting is difficult, I’ve changed the first-person button to “R1.” It feels very natural. Resident Evil players should be used to it as well. However, we’ll need to reconsider since this removes the quick-change and peek functions while in first-person. I went to see Eyes Wide Shut with Muraoka-san. The theater was fairly crowded. I’d heard a lot of bad reviews, but I found it fascinating. For two and a half hours, I was fully immersed in Kubrick’s world without falling asleep. Even at 70, he truly was a genius. Every frame had incredible composition. The lighting was stunning, especially in the bar scene. I didn’t expect the film to be this easy to understand. I’ll definitely have to watch Kubrick’s final work again.","99/9/19 (Thursday) I forgot to buy bread for breakfast last night, so had to make do with Weider in Jelly again this morning.

Sharks are a huge trope for anything set in the ocean, but I’m doing it anyway. Renny Harlin’s new film Deep Blue Sea releases next month. Zelda is casting its shadow on the tanker. The current lagging is due to the lack of model segmentation, so we’ll make the background processing much faster. The 1st person shooting was difficult to do, so changed the 1st person button to ""R1"". It controls very well. Resident Evil players are probably used to it. However, the buttons for quick change and the button for looking into the viewfinder when in 1st person are gone, so it needs review. I went to see Eyes Wide Shut with Muraoka. It was very crowded.

I’ve been thinking about the ""breath-holding"" mechanic for underwater operations. The idea is that as the O2 gauge decreases underwater, repeatedly pressing the action button would extend the character’s breath for a bit longer. The goal is to recreate the feeling and struggle of holding your breath underwater. This would be challenging in terms of controls, but no game has really captured that sensation yet. In previous games, the challenge in underwater sections was about finding the shortest route. If you failed, you’d have to start over from the beginning. In MGS2, it's different. When the path becomes unclear, you can press the button repeatedly to extend your breath and use that extra time to search for the correct route. By using the button-pressing technique well, the gameplay gains depth and a greater sense of freedom. I wrote the specifications for weapons. While I included them in the document, I think we should still scrap the idea of weapons (guns) being usable underwater. There’s concern about the ambiguity of firing a gun while in an underwater stance. At Matsubana’s desk, we experimented with the “Ikezu camera,” and it’s looking pretty good. Also, the movements for first-person attacks and cornering blend well with the clearing techniques taught by Mouri-san. There’s a new gameplay feel and satisfaction here that wasn’t in the previous game. The infiltration method now involves advancing, stopping, peeking in first-person, eliminating enemies with the gun, and then continuing forward.","99/8/23 (Monday) Summer vacation is over, and I will be living with my family again from Saturday. I'm thinking about specifications for ""breath-holding"" controls when underwater. The idea is that when your O2 gauge runs out under water, you have to you hit the action button repeatedly to hold your breath a little longer. The goal is to experience the sensation and pain of holding one's breath in water for real. It is difficult to control, but there are no games that can reproduce this sensation. In an event where you have to pass underwater, conventional games have you try to find the shortest distance route. If you fail the game starts over again from the starting point. MGS2 will not be like that, but instead be so that at points where the route becomes uncertain, you have to repeatedly press the button and make use of your extra breathing time to find the course. If you use the button presses well, your range will expand and deepen extensively. Wrote weapon specifications. I put it in the specification documents, but I think it's best to get rid of underwater weapons (guns). I am concerned about the guns being fired from ambiguous positions in the water. They were testing the fixed camera at Matsuhana’s station. It’s quite good. Also, the 1st person and the movements when turning corners well implement Mori’s lessons on clearing. It adds a new gameplay feel and enjoyment not found in the last game. It allows for an infiltration method of advancing, stopping, peaking in 1st person, eliminating targets with your gun, then advancing further.","","",""

TDL並。会場に着くと、「チケットを買うまで2時間、入るまで2時間!」とメガホンでがなり立てるスタッフ。あきらめて帰ろうとしたが、「嘘だよ!嘘言ってる!」と否定し続ける息子を信じて並び続ける。さすがに幾度となく、繰り返される脅しの声に萎えて、列から離脱する客も少なくはない。 なんと、4時間どころか、3時間弱で会場に入れる。息子の読み通りに感心する。とはいえ、会場はもの凄い人。息子は興奮して、会場内を走りまわる。特にAIBOがお気に入りのよう。会社に置いたままのAIBO、爛漫を、この際、家に持って帰ろうと思う。僕のほうは憧れのP2、P3を生で見れたことで涙が出そうになる。ただ、ASIMOはあまりにも人垣が多くて、肉眼では見れなかったのが残念である。会場内のカメラで中継されていたモニターを間接的に観るしかできなかった。背丈は息子と同じくらいなので、人垣の向こうでは何も見えない。肉眼で拝みたかった。SONYの人型ロボット(SDR)も同じくである。まあ、今そこに、人垣の向こうに確かにいるという存在感は感じられた。 「ROBODEX」の影響か、1年ぶりにわがAIBO、爛漫を起動させる。動いた。また動いた。なんだか、ぎこちない動きではあるが、壊れてはいない模様。年末に家に持って帰ろう。それまで、こまめに動かしてAIBOをある程度、成長させておかなければ。さすが会場で見たAIBO2とは比較にならないほど、動きが少ない。表現力に乏しい。 スクリプトメントを若干直して帰宅する。今日からフッシーがシナリオに入る。僕のスクリプトメントをいかに料理するか? キングの「ザ・スタンド」は読むのにしんどい。キャラクターが多いうえ、身の上話が徹密すぎる。お話が読めているぶん、キャラの造形を楽しむというのもありだが、ちょっとうんざり。""","[Sunday, November 26, 2000] I came to the office to work. Tomorrow, we have a meeting to revise the schedule for the Plant Chapter. I’ll prepare the materials for that today. Yesterday, I went to ROBODEX 2000 at Pacifico Yokohama. Because it was shown on TV, there were an insane number of people—on par with Tokyo Disneyland! When we arrived, staff with megaphones were shouting, ""It’s a two-hour wait to buy tickets, and another two hours to get in!"" I was about to give up and go home, but my son kept insisting, ""That’s a lie! They’re lying!"" Trusting him, we stayed in line. Many people around us gave up after hearing those warnings again and again, but we stuck it out. We managed to get in after about four hours. The venue was packed with people. My son was so excited, running around the entire place, especially captivated by AIBO. I thought I might as well bring home the AIBO that’s been sitting on the shelf at work. As for me, seeing P2 and P3 in person almost brought me to tears. Unfortunately, there were too many people around ASIMO, and I couldn’t see it with my own eyes. I could only watch it indirectly on the monitors streaming the footage from inside the venue. Since my son and I are about the same height, we couldn’t see anything past the crowd. I really wanted to see it up close. The same goes for SONY’s humanoid robot (SDR). Still, I could feel the presence of these robots, standing somewhere beyond the sea of people. Perhaps influenced by ROBODEX, I activated my own AIBO, which has been sitting dormant for a year. It moved. It moved again. It’s a bit clumsy, but at least it’s not broken. I’ll take it home for the New Year’s holiday. Until then, I’ll keep using it so it can grow a little. Compared to the AIBO2 I saw at the event, though, mine barely moves and has poor expressiveness. I made a few adjustments to the scriptment and headed home. Starting today, Fussy will begin working on the scenario. I wonder how he’ll refine my scriptment? Reading King’s The Stand is exhausting. There are so many characters, and the backstories are just too dense. I’m getting through the story, and it’s fun to appreciate the character development, but it’s still a bit tiresome.","00/11/26 (Sunday) I came to the office to work. Tomorrow I have a meeting on revising the schedule for the plant arc. I will prepare the preparatory materials before the end of the day. Yesterday, I went to ROBODEX 2000 held at Yokohama Pacifico. The event was broadcast on TV, so there were a lot of people there. Lines like Tokyo Disney Land. When I arrived at the venue, a staff member was shouting through a megaphone that, ""It takes 2 hours to buy a ticket and another 2 hours to get in!” I tried to give up and leave, but my son insisted that, “It’s a lie! He’s lying! He's lying!”, so we kept waiting in line. As you’d expect, the repeated warnings on the megaphone led many to get out of line. To my surprise, we were able to get into the venue in under 3 hours instead of 4. I was impressed by my son's reading of the situation. However, the venue was packed with people. My son was so excited as he ran around the venue. He looked especially interested in the AIBO. I think I'll bring home my AIBO, Ranamn, which I left at the office. It almost brought tears to my eyes to see my beloved P2 and P3 in the flesh. However, ASIMO was so crowded that I unfortunately couldn't see it with my own eyes. I could only watch it indirectly on a monitor that was being relayed by a camera at the venue. I am about the same height as my son, so I couldn't see anything beyond the crowd. I wish I could have seen it with my own eyes. Same with SONY's humanoid robot (SDR). But well, at least I could feel that it was there beyond the crowd. Perhaps because I was influenced by Robodex, I started up my AIBO, Ranman, for the first time in a year. It still worked. It moved somewhat awkwardly, but it was not broken. Will take it home at the end of the year. Until then, I have to move it frequently and let the AIBO grow to some extent. Of course, there’s no comparison to the AIBO2 we saw at the event, given how limited its motions are. It lacks expressive power. Made slight adjustments to the scriptment and went back home. From today, Fussy will start working on the plot. What will he cook up with my scriptment? Stephen King’s The Stand is tough to read. There are a lot of characters and their backgrounds are too detailed. From what I’ve read so far, there are some character arcs I’m excited to see, but it’s frustrating.","","",""

"scan/entry_124.png","""00・11・28 (火) ひと晩帰って考えてみると、やはりボス戦が少なすぎる。チャイナマン戦をそのままヴァンプで行なうことに変更する。ボス戦用、底なしプールもそのままいく。チャイナマンもヴァンプも機敏でナイフ使いであることを考えると、ある程度、キャラが被る。これでヴァンプは計5回登場することとなり、最多出場のボスになる。 新ちゃんの意向で、プラント編のゴルルコビッチ兵の銃をAK74Uからアバカン AN94に変更する。ただし、VIP兵はこれまでどおり、AKも持たせる。ライデンが入手できるのはしたがってAK。 またハイテク兵 (ロボコップ) の使用するOICWをやめて、M4にする。プログラム的にやばそうなので、無難なほうに変更。OICWは見栄えが面白いが、モーションがすべてつくり直しになる。今日もつらい決断。 人質部屋が、ネギーのところでなぜかイベント会場になっていた。大統領が演説するために内装などを行なっていたという設定。無理はないので、そのままでGOを出す。いいほうに転ぶ現場での変更は肯定する。ただ最近は報告や許可を受けずに現場レベルで独自に行なっていることが多い。しかも、企画内容のことは全くと言っていいほど考慮されていない。それもそのはず、多くのスタッフが仕様書やバイブルとなるスクリプトメントを読破していないのだ。理由を聞くと、「読むの大変なんです」と返答する。制作やめたら? といつも思う。 SCEに提出するリマスターを作成。明日の朝に再提出。""","2000-11-28 (Tuesday) After going home and thinking it over, I realized there really aren’t enough boss fights. So, I’ve decided to have the China Man fight be handled by Vamp instead. We’ll keep the bottomless pool for the boss fight. Since both China Man and Vamp are agile and use knives, their characters overlap to some extent. With this, Vamp will appear in a total of five scenes, making him the boss with the most appearances. Based on Xin-chan’s suggestion, we’re changing the rifles used by the Gurlukovich soldiers in the Plant chapter from AK74U to Abakan AN94. However, the VIP guards will still carry AKs as before. This means the weapon Raiden will acquire will also be the AK. Additionally, we’ve decided to replace the OICW used by the high-tech soldiers (Robocop units) with the M4. The OICW is visually interesting, but it would require reworking all the animations, which seems risky from a programming standpoint. This is another tough decision, but it’s the safer option. At Negi’s station, the hostage room had somehow become an event hall. The idea was that the president was giving a speech, so they redecorated the interior. It doesn’t feel too forced, so we’ll proceed with it. I support these kinds of on-the-spot changes when they turn out well. However, lately, there have been many changes made at the field level without reports or approvals, and they often don’t take the planned design into consideration. It’s no surprise, though—most of the staff haven’t read the spec documents or the scriptment, which is supposed to be their bible. When I ask why, they respond, “It’s hard to read.” I always feel like saying, “Then why are you working in development?” I’m creating the remaster to submit to SCE. We’ll resubmit it tomorrow morning.","00/11/28 (Tuesday) After going home for the night and thinking about it, I realized that there are still too few boss fights. Decided to use the Chinaman boss fight as is with Vamp. The bottomless pool for boss fights will also remain the same. Considering that Chinaman and Vamp are both clever knife-wielders, they did overlap as characters to an extent. This means that Vamp will appear 5 times, the most of any boss. At Shinchan’s suggestion, changed the Gurlukovich soldiers’ guns in the plant arc from AK-74U to Abakan AN-94. However, VIP soldiers will also have AKs as before. Raiden will therefore be able to obtain AKs. Also, the OICW used by high-tech soldiers (robocops) will be replaced by the M4. They would have been a pain to program, so we changed it to the safer option. The OICW is interesting to look at, but all the animations would have had to be reworked. Another tough decision today. The hostage room was turned into an event hall at Negi's station for some reason. It was decorated for the president's speech. It was not unreasonable, so I decided to give it the go ahead as is. I’ll accept changes at the site that turn out to be for the better. However, recently, a lot of this stuff is being done independently at the site level without being reported or approved. In addition, the content of the project is not known to all the staff members. Moreover, the content of the project is not taken into consideration at all. The reason for this is, unsurprisingly, that many staff members have not read through the specifications or the scriptment, the bible of the whole project. When asked why, they reply ""It's too hard to read them.” I always think, ""Why don't you quit production then?"" I made a remaster for submission to SCE.

What I said back then and what I want to do going forward hasn’t changed. Even though that was a tough time physically two years ago, I seemed more energetic. I feel a bit embarrassed about not having changed, but it’s clear that my physical and especially mental strength has weakened. I’ve been taking the oral medication (anti-allergy drugs) I got from the hospital, and my skin condition has improved. It might just be my perception, but my skin feels normal again. Matsubana took the remastered demo to SCE. Estimating the total gameplay time of MGS2, the Tanker chapter is about 1 hour 30 minutes, disarming the bombs in the Plant takes about 2 hours 30 minutes, from the Central Building to Shell 2 is 1 hour, from Shell 2 to the sniping section is 2 hours, Arsenal is 1 hour, and the final section is another hour... which makes for a total of about 10 hours. It's longer than the previous game. I’m organizing the structure of the Plant chapter. The first half is stealth-focused, while the second half is more event-driven. The boss fights are balanced too. I think it’s turning out reasonably well. The question is whether we can actually achieve this on schedule. I played Z.O.E. The sound effects I ordered have started coming in, but the sound design is still rough. The audio direction hasn’t been established, and the presentation isn’t there yet. The difficulty balance is too bland, so I instructed adjustments to the enemy guards’ responses, encounter frequency, evasion timers, and other parameters. The second player character, ""Nate,"" has once again become dull and “nebula-like,” losing its appeal. Without any instructions, Xin-chan added lighting to the stages in Z.O.E. As expected from Yoji Shinkawa, I’m impressed today! It seems that the changes will be reflected in the CD tomorrow, so I’m looking forward to it.","00/11/29 (Wednesday) Before going to bed last night, I re-read my interviews in the previous MGS mook book, story book, strategy book, etc. What I said, and what I want to do in the future hasn’t changed.

Today, it's much colder than usual. I revisited and refined the Vamp fight again. Vamp can escape underwater, but Raiden won’t be able to enter the pool. At this point, Raiden will have most of his weapons, so I’m thinking of ways to let the player counter strategically using various weapons. Instead of limiting the player to only a few effective weapons, I want to ensure that the characteristics of all the weapons can be utilized, allowing each player’s personal strategy to shine. It will be similar to the Raven fight from the previous game. Since there’s no scene or event where Raiden’s first-person punch is useful, I’ll have him target Vamp’s weak point (his side). I’m concerned about the co-op event with Snake in the Arsenal corridor—it seems shaky from a programming perspective. Even though the team has spent a year on enemy AI, it’s still at its current level of intelligence. The first rule of game design and planning is that we shouldn’t rely on the programmers’ abilities, especially for intelligent enemies and NPCs. I’m debating whether to change the design specifications. We’re reviewing the water gameplay mechanics again. We’ll treat the surface and underwater segments as separate forced motions, and develop them with the idea that they’re practically separate stages. At night, I watched Mad Max 2 on TV for the first time in a while. The voice acting had changed—Mel Gibson was voiced by Kōichi Yamadera. I’ve seen it over ten times, but no matter how many times I watch it, it’s still great. The direction is incredible. The camera work, the angles... but the most amazing part is the first half. It consistently shows the setting and situations from Max’s perspective. The subjective shots and the binocular view make the audience experience what Max is going through. Young George Miller was just too good!","00/11/30 (Thursday) It's the last day of November. It is remarkably cold again today. Revised Vamp’s boos fight. Made it so Vamp is able to escape into the water, but Raiden can’t enter the pool. At this point, Raiden has most of his weapons. So, he will be able to devise ways to fight back strategically with a variety of weapons. It won’t be that only a limited number of weapons and equipment will be effective, but that the characteristics of each weapon will be applicable, allowing players to do things their own way. This is similar to the fight with Raven in the last game. Also, there weren’t any scenes or events where the 1st person punch was effective, so made it so you can aim for Vamp’s weak spot (his sides). There’s a joint event with Snake in the Arsenal corridor. but I am very uneasy about the programming. With the enemy soldier intelligence being what it currently is after a year of work, we need to decide whether to change the specifications or not as soon as possible. The number one thing that shouldn’t be done in game design and planning is to leave things up to the programmer's ability. Especially smart enemies and non-player characters. Considered the underwater specifications again. Will separate the surface and underwater with forced animation. and as much as possible, they should be created as separate stages. At night, I watched Mad Max 2 on TV for the first time in a while. The dubbing had changed, and Mel Gibson was dubbed by Koichi Yamadera. I've already seen the movie more than 10 times, but it's still interesting no matter how many times I see it. The direction is amazing. The use of the camera, the angles ...... The most amazing part is the direction of the first half. We already see the setting and the situation from the same point of view as Max. 1st person and binocular view footage.

I’m often scolded by outsiders who say, “If you protect your staff too much, nothing good will come of it.” Creating something isn’t cool or stylish. This is something that younger people who entered the game industry during its rise in popularity don’t seem to understand. There are few people who came to the game industry because they wanted to create something. Most came because the industry is profitable or because it’s in the spotlight. And then, as soon as they join, they start calling themselves creators—even though they haven’t made anything yet. I played through the cargo hold. The neck exercises and the “thrilling” events seem like they’ll work. However, the camera might need to be pulled back quite a bit. When the camera is pulled back, it becomes harder to display everything properly, and the number of soldiers decreases.

Although it’s still a placeholder map, the lighting is mostly in place. The regular camera angles have also been set, and while the enemy routes haven’t been fully adjusted yet, the soldiers have been placed. However… it’s not good. Major revisions will be necessary. The heliport and the armory, in particular, will need significant reworking. The tightrope section seems promising. I’ll add more gimmicks and make further adjustments. That said, from a gameplay perspective, this part severely limits the player’s freedom. While it aligns with the original plan, the tension created by the bomb-disarming gameplay so far, which allowed a high degree of freedom—going forward, backward, left, or right—is replaced here with an old-fashioned, stage-clearing style. You can only move forward, and I’m worried that this might bore the player. The flow within the game was crafted with intention, but when actually playing it, some parts feel different from what I imagined. I’ll keep an eye on it and make adjustments. What’s even more concerning, though, is the underwater scene. Watching the placeholder version from Sonoyama-kun’s station gives off a dangerous vibe. We’ll need to make a decision soon. I’m also changing the sniping scene from the second floor to the first floor. The initial Claymore corridor is hard to see, so we’re moving it down. Plus, the angle from below gives the Plant an imposing appearance, so we’ll go with that. The textures for the underside of the Plant don’t seem to be an issue, so that should work fine.","00/12/11 (Monday) The long-awaited Plant arc #3 has been burned, so I checked it out. Although it is a temporary map, the lights are in place to some extent. The normal camera is also in place. The routes of enemy soldiers have not been adjusted yet, but they are in place. However...... it’s not good. We have to make major corrections. The helipad and armory in particular need a lot of work. The tight rope area looks workable. Will add in additional gimmicks and revise it. However, the game offers very limited freedom at this point. It is as initially planned, but compared to the tension of the demolition scene that gave a lot of freedom to go forward, backward, left and right, it’s more like an old-fashioned linear type level. In any case, we can only move forward. I'm worried that people will get bored here. We planned for gameplay flow as we made it, but now that it’s actually put together, it’s different from how I had imagined it. Will see how things go and make adjustments. What is more frightening is the underwater scene. I smelled the scent of danger as I saw a temporary version starting up at Sonoyama’s station. We need a conclusion at an early stage. The first claymore corridor was hard to see, so lowered it down. The angle from below makes the plant look grander, so will do it that way. The texture of the backside of the plant doesn’t appear to have any problems, so it’s probably fine.","","",""

The Nikita missile section is quite difficult. First, it's hard to locate the power panel, and the pipe connections are confusing. To address this, we’ll place a pipe map (blueprint) on the wall. Even if you know the route, it’s almost impossible to clear, similar to the highest difficulty in VR missions. As a solution, firing from the small room with the gun cameras will make it much easier. With just a hint, even players without much skill can clear it. I’ll decide how much help to provide through the Polydemo and the initial radio transmissions as we go along. Although I considered removing this event from the game several times, some staff argued, “MGS needs these kinds of tricky events,” which I can understand. However, I’m still unsure if new players will be able to handle it. As for the underwater mode map, after playing it again, it’s still not fun. Additionally, the Vamp fight map’s background has been “casually” changed by the scenario and background teams. This is a critical section. It's not about the visual appeal—it’s essential to prioritize the original design, concept, and gameplay. We need to simulate and create the boss fight with care... In the evening, I went to Jingu-mae Studio for the PS2 party. I first went to the BF2 waiting room and had a bento. Eating at the event makes it feel like we’re all working together somehow. However, I wasn’t very hungry and left half of it. The waiting room was packed with Konami staff. Even though it was supposed to be shared with other companies, I felt a bit bad about it. Inafune-san happened to pass by, and we had a long conversation in the room. He said the master for Onimusha is almost done, and they’ll submit it in two days. I felt envious looking at him. Will I feel this same sense of relief at this time next year? The PS2 party started at 6:30 p.m. The venue quickly filled with media people. There were live camera interviews for each of the 14 titles being released in January. MGS2 was the last to be featured, probably because we still don’t have a release date. Onimusha finished quickly, and Inafune-san left, saying, “Now I’m off to the Media Works end-of-year party.” What a courteous guy. For two and a half hours, I stood with no food, no drinks... and hardly any interviews. People kept mistaking me for an SCE representative, asking, “Excuse me, are you with SCE?” When I said “No,” they’d respond, “Oh, you must be in charge of this game,” and walk away. It seems they were only interested in interviewing SCE’s PR people. Others kept asking, “Is there any famous creator here?” right in front of me. The party ended just before 9 p.m. Maruyama-san and Saeki-san from promotions came by to greet me.","00/12/12 (Tuesday) Made major revisions based on the long-awaited Plant arc #3. The Nikita missile is proving quite tough. First of all, I don't know where the power panels are. I don't know how the pipes are connected. As a solution, we will paste a map of the pipes (blue) on the wall. Even if you know the location of the pipes, you can't clear it. It’s the same as the VR on maximum difficulty. This makes it impossible for normal players to clear. As a solution, will make it easy to get from the small room with the gun camera. As long as hints are given, it can be cleared without any skill. Will decide on the rest after seeing how many hints are in the polygon cutscenes and radio segments at the beginning. I have thought about removing these kinds of events from the game countless times, but I can agree with the opinions of staff that say, MGS needs these kinds of mean events. I wonder if new players will stick around. The map in the underwater mode was still not interesting when I played it again. In addition, the background of the map for the fight with Vamp was changed by people on the story and landscape teams “just because.” That’s an important part. The original design, planning, and gameplay must be prioritized, not the appearance of the map. And we need to simulate the boss fight while we make it….. In the evening, I went to Jingumae studio for a PS2 party. First, I went to the BF2 waiting room and ate bento. The bento here really is good. It motivates me to work together with everyone. However, I didn't have much of an appetite, so I left a lot of it uneaten. The waiting room was almost full of people from Konami. That’s a bit regrettable, since it was supposed to be shared with people from other companies too. Inafune happened to walk by and talk to us in the room. He said the master of Onimusha is almost finished. The submission is 2 days from now. Seeing him, I feel jealous. Will I be that bright around this time next year? The PS2 party started at 6:30 pm. The venue was filled with members of the media. It filled up right away. Interviews were conducted on live camera for each of the titles released in January. A total of 14 titles. MGS2 was the last one up. Of course, this is probably because the release date has not yet been decided. After Onimusha was finished, Inafune told the audience, ""I'm going to the Media Works year-end party now” and left. How very courteous of him. Two and a half hours on my feet, no food, no alcohol...... and almost no interviews. People kept mistakenly asking if I was someone from SCE. When I told them that I wasn’t, they would say, ""Oh, so you must be the person in charge of this game then?” and walk away. I guess they want to interview SCE's PR person. A lot of people would ask “are there any famous creators here?” right in front of me. The party ended before 9pm. Maruyama and Saiki from the promotion team came to greet me.","","",""

Yoshiike is also updating the map to follow the original design specified in the scriptment. The number of times the player can surface for air is reduced to two. The location of the thermal goggles has also been changed. An item (Nikita) is placed in a hidden duct in the Nikita room. There was a problem regarding what to do if the player puts the enemy soldiers to sleep during the disguise event. The solution is to increase the number of enemies. Additionally, we’re reusing the Tanker chapter’s bottle and grain programming (gimmicks) in this section. The enemy waiting room has relatively light processing, so we can display around ten soldiers. The Harrier is now displayed on the bridge for the Harrier fight. Its size is as calculated, though I’m worried it doesn’t have the same intimidating presence as the Hind. To check the display processing, we’ll also add some seagulls flying around. I walked around the outer perimeter and central building in the third version of the Plant chapter. There are some issues, like the thinness of the D-leg and the CD connecting bridge, but overall, including the tightrope section, the outer perimeter scenes seem fine from a design perspective. The intended vertical structure, where the player needs to stay alert and move forward while watching behind them, works well. Fukushima is working on revising the script. The first draft should be ready around next week. Up until now, it’s been a closed, personal creation process for me, but now it will be a draft objectively revised by someone else. I want to proceed carefully so that the core doesn’t get blurred, like in Hollywood movies. I got a call from Xin-chan, who is on a business trip in the U.S. The meeting with McFarlane went well, even though it lasted for four hours. That’s a relief. I have high expectations for this figure line. Even if it’s cold, I’ll have to attend the Toy Show in February.","00/12/14 (Thursday) Continued modifying the scriptment from yesterday since they changed the map of the underwater scene.

An item (Nikita) will be placed in the hidden duct of the Nikita room. What should be done when an enemy soldier is put to sleep in a disguise event? The problem will be dealt with by increasing the number of enemy soldiers. We’ll also place the bottle and grain programs (gimmicks) in the tanker arc and divert it. The waiting room for enemy soldiers is relatively easy to process, so we can display about 10 enemy soldiers. Had them display a harrier at the harrier fight bridge. The size was as calculated. I am worried that it’s not as intimidating as the Hind. We also had a seagull fly over to see how the display was processed. Tried walking around the perimeter and central building of plant #3. There are some points that need modifications, such as the D leg and CD connecting bridge being thin, but the perimeter scenes look okay from a planning standpoint, including the tightrope. The three-dimensional gimmick of cautiously moving forward and backward in harmony was successful, as was the goal. Fukushima has started revising the script. The first draft should be coming around next week or so. It had been my own closed creation so far, but now it will be a draft revised from other perspectives.

The sound design is still missing, and of course, the movies aren’t in place yet. The challenge now is how effectively we can use effects in the remaining time. I’m still debating whether I should edit the loop demo myself. Fukushima sent over the revised plan up to the Fatman fight. I adopted the suggested revisions and deletions, and placed them into a new folder. It’s interesting—when the script is interpreted objectively, I find that many of the revisions make sense. However, the kind of ideas I was hoping for aren’t there yet. I finally got John Wetton’s new album (Welcome to Heaven). For once, when I asked the store clerk for “John Wetton’s…”, they actually understood. The clerk led me to the progressive rock section, where the album was laid out flat. There was even a free desk calendar included. The 5.1 channel sound system arrived. We set it up in the seminar room. As a test, we watched the Omaha Beach scene from Saving Private Ryan. While it doesn’t quite match the experience of a theater, the sense of immersion was impressive. If we could replicate that in MGS2, it would be incredible. However, that level of sound immersion isn’t possible during gameplay, and that’s the problem. Only during cutscene playback can we get that level of immersion, and it still feels lacking. In Saving Private Ryan, you can hear where the soldiers are being shot at from—this kind of audio detail is amazing in a 2D space.","00/12/18 (Monday) Submitted the pre-master of Z.O.E. to SCE.

It had just rained, but it truly felt like the arrival of winter. I bought Yukinobu Hoshino’s deluxe book, Midway Rekishi-hen. Apparently, it's to celebrate his 25th anniversary since his manga debut. I read the first two chapters. They're from his early days, so the artwork is a bit rough, but they’re still good. These are his own personal selections, and his dramatic art is remarkable. I’ve read the stories from chapter three onward before, but I’ll revisit them. When I reach my 25th anniversary in the gaming industry, it will be around 2010-2011. I wonder if I’ll still be making games by then? It's not that far away—about ten years into the future. My son will be 17, which is often said to be a challenging age. I suddenly feel the urge to strive to reach my 25th anniversary in the gaming industry! I’ve never felt this way before.

I'll take some time, revise it, and submit it by the weekend. I went to the club for the first time in about two weeks because I had injured my leg. It felt great to swim again after a break. I played the English version of Z.O.E. The voice actor, who is actually 14, sounds quite fresh. However, the female voices for Viola, ADA, Selvice, and Elena are all quite similar, so they overlap. Norman's voice is better in this version. However, they all have a cartoonish acting style. We’re preparing the loop demo for Z.O.E. I’ll do a rough edit tomorrow, and if it seems doable, I’ll finalize it by the end of the month. The movie near the ending where the Atlantis bends a beam is uncool, so I’m having it removed. John Wetton’s new album is great. His voice, melody, and vocal style are soothing to my soul. It’s healing for me. I started reading the second half of King's The Stand yesterday. Thinking that this was written 25 years ago leaves me with mixed feelings. This is the second book I've read by King, and it's very well done. His character development and plotting are phenomenal. This is probably what makes King’s work so fascinating. It's also understandable why his books are difficult to adapt into films—they have a structure and form that can only be expressed in novel form. MGS also embodies something that can only be expressed in a game.","00/12/19 (Tuesday) In the morning, when I opened the front door, the sky was still dark. Part of it may be that it just rained, but winter has truly arrived. I bought a deluxe edition copy of Midway: History Series by Yukinobu Hoshino. It was the 25th anniversary of his debut as a manga artist. I read the first two stories. The drawings were a bit lacking, but they were good. I heard he special selected them, but his graphic images are excellent. I have already read the stories from the 3rd on, but I will read them again. When I celebrate the 25th anniversary of my gaming career, it will be the year ......2010-2011. Will I still be making games then? Thinking about 10 years in the future, it’s not far from now. My son will be 17 years old, which as they report these days, is a difficult age to be. I want to keep working on games until my 25th anniversary! I suddenly feel that way. I never thought so before. I wonder what's going on? I wrote a manuscript for the mook book of Avalon. As usual, I found myself writing more than 800 characters. That's easily twice what I needed. I'll take some time to revise and submit it by the end of the week. I went to the club for the first time in almost two weeks because of a leg injury. It had been a while since I swam, so it felt good. Played the English version of Z.O.E. The voice actors, who are actually 14 years old, are very fresh. The female voices are pretty close to Viola, Ada, Celvice, and Elena, so it's a double. Norman is better here. But they’re all cartoonish performances. I'm going to start preparing a loop cutscene of Z.O.E., and I'll edit it tentatively tomorrow and finish it at the end of the day. The cutscene near the ending with the beam bending around Atlantis is uncool, so I'll have it removed. John Wetton's new album is good. His voice, melody, and vocal style are soothing. It's healing for me. Since yesterday, I have been reading the second volume of Stephen King's The Stand. I have mixed feelings when I think about how it was written 25 years ago. This was King's second novel, but it is very well written. The characterization and plotting are terrific. This is what makes King so interesting. But I can also understand why his original work couldn’t be adapted to film. They have a structure and form that can only be expressed in a novel. MGS is also something that can only be expressed in a game.","Yukinobu Hoshino (星野之宣): A well-known manga artist in Japan. Avalon (『Avalon』): A Japanese science fiction film directed by Mamoru Oshii.

It freezes when entering the long hallway, so I played up to the engine room instead. Including the engine room brings coherence to the Tanker's map. Also, by going back and forth on the same map when heading to the cargo hold after defeating Olga on the bridge, it adds depth to the structure and strategic challenge. There's still a lot of tweaking needed, but it's becoming more interesting. The engine room should have a slightly higher difficulty level, making it a peak moment of the stage.

All I could do was play up until the engine room. Adding in the engine room makes the tanker map feel more consistent. Also, by using the same map for the course of going up to the bridge, defeating Olga, and then going to the hold, it adds depth to the structure and how you approach it. Adjustments still need to be made, but it is interesting. Will make the engine room more difficult so it becomes a climax to the stage.

Beings of the most disgusting and frightening shapes and colors, beyond what I can put into words, and most of them chasing me. I dream of things like my teeth being torn to shreds. Every night, several times, I wake up feeling so uncomfortable. It makes me hate going to sleep. I felt chills even while I was dreaming.","","",""
"scan/entry_149.png","01・1・15 (月) 那須での会議で発売日が決まった。国内版も厳しすぎる(不可能に近い?) が英語版や欧州版がつらい。スコットが帰ってきているので、相談して予定を再検討。ケツが決まっているので、できることは限られている。 食事や休暇中、ふと「MGS2」の予定がのしかかってくる。押しつぶそうとする。 食欲がない。食べないとダメだとわかっていながらも、どうしようもない。なんとか飲み込むように食べる。 ベーヤンの水面処理を観る。さすがに嵐の波よりは軽い。カメラを上下方向にズラすとテクスチャの効果が出るが、俯瞰にするとダメ。カメラをパンしてしまうと、うまくテクスチャをごまかして描かないと、映り込んでいないのがバレてしまうようだ。しかし、プールの水面(表面)などは使える処理だ。ただし、D脚に入れてもらった結果では、主観時などでかなり接写するために、さらにポリゴンを細かくするしかなさそう。 フッシーがいじったラスト部分をチェックする。4分の1は減っている。ただフォーチュンが独自の意志で行動を起こそうとする部分･･････キャラ的におかしい。と うすべきか? スクリプトメント、すべてを再チェッ ク。明日からセリフ修正を行なう。 前回も最後はこの方法をとった。キャメロンが「T2」 で実践した方法である。まず最後まで僕がスクリプト メントを書き上げる。それを今度は客観的に見れる別 人(福島)にゆだねる。彼は彼なりの視点でスクリプ トメントを修正する。ゲームデザインの部分ではなく、 特にスクリプトメント部分。 続いて客観視されて返ってきたものを、再び僕が修正 する。「ああ、なるほど。他人はこういうふうにうけ とるのか･････」などを検証する。そして修正したもの をまたフッシーに返す。そうやってキャッチボールを 続けていく。このやり方が良いか悪いかは別にして、 ハリウッドでは当たり前のやり方だ。時間がないとき はこの方法がいい。しかし、悪い部分もある。キャラ クターの言いまわしや個性がシーンで変わってしまう。 またそれぞれの作家性が削れて、平坦にならされてし まう。 「ポリスノーツ』や『スナッチャー』のときはよかっ た。今後は企画だけをやって任せるか、また昔のよう に全部自分で閉じたつくり方をするか、どちらかをし なければストレスが溜まってしかたがない。 アシスタントに応援を依頼するが、今週は予約が入っ て埋まっている模様。いつもの席では仕事が進まな い。こもる場所はないものか? 刀とスネークサポートの仕様を切るかどうか? いま だに判断つかず。スネークはやりたいが、刀はゲーム 的に怪しい。危険である。 新ちゃんから「ファットマン」の最終設定が上がって くる。よくよく考えてみると、ボムプラストスーツの 高い襟のお陰で顔半分が見えない。つまり、口パクが 必要ない。これはいい! と喜んでいたが、ワインを 飲むシーンで、飲めないので、カクテルグラスにして ストローで飲ませることに変更。それにしても、怖い 顔。幾度となく爆弾を爆破させたに違いない。僕のイ メージとは180度違う形相だが、OKとしよう。本来 なら、あの形相の男は神経をつかうような作業には向 いていない。あれではまるでプロレスラーだ。","2001-1-15 (Monday) At the meeting in Nasu, the release date was decided. The domestic version is already extremely tight (almost impossible?), but the English and European versions will be even tougher. Scott is back, so we discussed and reviewed the schedule. With the deadline set, our options are limited. Even during meals and breaks, the MGS2 schedule weighs heavily on my mind, pressing down on me. I have no appetite. I know I need to eat, but I can’t help it. I force myself to swallow something. I watched Beyan's water surface effects. They’re lighter than the storm waves, as expected. The texture effect appears when the camera tilts vertically, but it doesn’t work in a top-down view. When the camera pans, we need to cleverly disguise the texture; otherwise, it becomes obvious that it's not rendering correctly. However, the effect is usable for things like the pool's water surface. That said, the D Strut results indicate that due to close-ups during first-person view, we’ll need to add more polygonal detail. I reviewed the final part that Fussy tweaked. It's been reduced by a quarter. However, the part where Fortune tries to act on her own... it feels out of character. What should we do? I'll go through the script again. Starting tomorrow, I'll make revisions to the dialogue. I used this method last time as well. It's the approach Cameron used in Terminator 2. First, I write out the script to the end. Then, I hand it over to someone else (Fukushima) who can look at it objectively. He revises the script from his perspective, focusing particularly on the script rather than the game design aspects. After that, I revise what’s been sent back to me with fresh eyes. ""Ah, I see. This is how others interpret it..."" I examine these insights and then send the revised version back to Fussy. We continue this back-and-forth process. Whether this method is good or bad, it’s a common practice in Hollywood. When time is short, this method is effective. However, it has its downsides. The characters’ phrasing and personalities can change from scene to scene, and each writer's individuality can get sanded down to a flat sameness. It was better during Policenauts and Snatcher. Moving forward, I either need to handle just the planning and delegate the rest, or go back to making things entirely by myself like I did in the past. Otherwise, the stress will just keep building up. I asked for an assistant’s help, but it seems they're fully booked this week. I can't get much work done at my usual desk. Is there no place I can seclude myself? Should I cut the sword and the Snake support feature? I still can't decide. I want to include Snake, but the sword is questionable from a gameplay perspective. It’s risky. Shin-chan sent over the final design for Fatman. On closer inspection, the high collar of the bomb blast suit covers half his face, which means there’s no need for lip-syncing. That's great! However, in the wine-drinking scene, he can't drink with the suit, so we’ll change it to a cocktail glass with a straw. That being said, he has a terrifying face. He must have blown up numerous bombs. His expression is entirely different from what I had imagined, but I’ll go with it. Normally, someone with that look wouldn't be suited for delicate work. He looks more like a professional wrestler.","01/1/15 (Monday) The release date was decided at the meeting in Nasu. The Japanese version’s deadline is too strict (near impossible?) and the English and European editions are tough too. Scott has returned so we're going to discuss and re-evaluate our plans. Since the endpoint is set in stone, we are limited in what we can do. During lunch and break time, the MGS2 schedule suddenly weighed heavily on me. I tried to shrug it off. I have no appetite. I know I need to eat, but there is nothing I can do about it. I managed to swallow down what I could. Watch Beyan's (Not sure who this is) water surface processing. As expected, the waves are lighter than those of a storm. Texture effects do appear when moving the camera up and down, but it doesn’t work at high angles. If we don’t balance the camera well and play tricks with the textures, it will give away that it isn’t reflective. However, this processing can be used for the surface of swimming poos. But as a result of adding in the D-legs and being able to get a very close-up view in 1st person, we’ll need to make the polygons even more detailed. Checked the last part where Fusshi had made some changes. It’s been reduced by a quarter. However, the part where Fortune tries to act on her own…….seems odd for the character. What should we do? Will check the whole scriptment again. Will start on line revisions tomorrow. This was how we did things last time. It’s what Cameron did with T2. First, I write the scriptment until the end. Then, I give it to another person (Fukushima), who can look at it objectively. He revises the script from his own point of view. Not the game design part, but the scriptment part in particular. I then revise the scriptment again after it has been objectively viewed and returned. I consider how other people would perceive it. Then I return the corrected version to Fusshi again. In this way, we continue to play catch with each other. Whether this method is good or bad, it is a common practice in Hollywood. It’s a good method when short on time. However, there are drawbacks. The characters' speaking styles and personalities change from scene to scene. Also, the various individual writer’s personalities are lost, and things are flattened. It worked well with Policenauts and Snatcher. From now on, I have to either do only the planning and leave the rest to others, or close the entire production process by myself like in the past. If I don’t pick one or the other I’ll be overwhelmed with stress. I ask my assistant for the reception room, but it seems that it’s booked up with appointments this week. I can't get work done in my usual seat. Is there any place I can seclude myself? And whether or not to cut the sword and Snake support specs? I still can't decide. I'd like to do the Snake stuff, but the sword would be iffy gameplay-wise. There are risks there. Shin-chan sent me the final settings for Fat Man. I thought about it carefully and realized that the high abdomen of the bomb-blast suit makes it impossible to see half his face, which means there is no need for lip-synching. This is good! I was pleased, but it means he can’t drink during the scene where they drink wine, so I changed it to a cocktail glass and had him drink it with a straw. But still, he has a scary face. He must have blown up bombs more than once. His face is a 180-degree shift from what I envisioned, but I gave it the OK. Normally, a man with such a face is not suited for nerve-racking work. He looks like a professional wrestler.","Nasu (那須): A region in Japan Policenauts (ポリスノーツ) and Snatcher (スナッチャー): Previous games created by Hideo Kojima.","",""

I added an item called the ""Hair Removal Device."" It's a rare item that you can obtain by putting Emma to sleep and shaking her. If you have it, Raiden's armpit hair disappears. But honestly, who would even care? Kanekichi Soldier was created. He's a soldier who climbs from the tanker deck to the upper deck after the Olga fight. After a set time, he dives off the railing and disappears. His prestigious dog tag bears the name ""Kanekichi,"" making it one of the rare IDs. Later on, you can also put Snake to sleep and get his ID. The problem is deciding what name to put on Snake's dog tag. It might be awkward to use the player's name. I shared some ideas about the underwater effects with Okajii and Shibata-kun. Personally, I hope we can convey a sense of being underwater and floating without using underwater fog. First, let's see how far we can go with bubbles and floating particles. The key is the refraction of light. I want to place lights on the walls to see how they can be visually appealing. I aim for something different from typical game underwater effects. Worst case, we might have to use some raster-like processing, but I don't want to do that. Most games use this kind of effect for underwater scenes. In reality, that kind of wavering effect doesn’t happen underwater. Light refracts from above, and only the light bends. If we can pull this off, it will be an effect that goes down in history. I want this to be a new world, following the rain splashes. The last resort is to use floating everyday objects. I gave Okajii and the others a video edited with reference underwater scenes from The Abyss, Alien: Resurrection, Deep Blue Sea, and The Relic, along with the original videos. I suggested buying a water tank, but it might flood the room, so that idea is on hold. I watched a rough cut of the polygon demo for the sinking of the tanker. It's long, but Ocelot, the Colonel, and Snake look like they’re having fun. They’re full of life. This is the unique tension that only MGS can deliver. We'll show this video at E3. I placed a Marine on the upper route of the cargo hold. You can obtain his dog tag through a ""Hold Up."" Also, in the far corner of the lower route, by RAY's feet, I positioned Ocelot (his boots) so that you can take a photo. However, you can't attack him.","01/1/16 (Tuesday) I couldn’t use the reception room for language checks, so I worked on the scriptment at my seat. Added the shaver as an item. This is a rare item that can be obtained by putting Emma to sleep and shaking her. If you have it, Raiden's armpit hair will disappear. I wonder who will be happy about that? The Kanekichi soldier was born. He’s a soldier who comes up to the observation deck from the tanker deck after the battle with Olga. After a certain amount of time, he dives off the railing and disappears. Kanekichi's name is on his prestigious dog tag. One of the rare IDs. Also later in the game, will make it so Snake is also put to sleep so that you can take his dog tag. The problem is what name to give Snake's dog tag. Having it be the player’s name might be tough. I gave Okaji and Shibata some ideas for underwater effects. I'm hoping to create a sense of being underwater and floating without underwater fog. How far can we go with bubbles and floating garbage? The key is the refraction of light. How can we make it more attractive by having lights placed on the wall? I want to aim to create something unlike underwater effects in past games. Worst case scenario, we would have to add a raster-like effect. I don't want to do that. Most of the underwater effects in games are like this. In actuality, you don't see that kind of shimmering underwater. The light from the top is just refracted and only the light bends. If this could be done, it would be an effect that would go down in history. A new world that seems to follow droplets of rain. A floating commodity is the last resort. I will give Okaji the edited videos of reference underwater footage such as Flood, Alien 4, Deep Blue Sea, Deep Rising, and others, as well as the original videos. I suggested that we buy a fish tank, but postponed the idea because I don’t want the room to be flooded. I watched the placeholder poly-cutscene of the tanker sinking. It's long. But Ocelot, Colonel, and Snake seem to be enjoying themselves. They look lively. It’s the tension you’d expect from MGS. Will show the video at E3. Placed one Marine on the upper route of the hold. You can get a dog tag from this Marine using a hold up. Also, placed Ocelot (his boots) at the foot of RAY at the end of the lower route so that you can photograph him. You cannot attack.","Polygon demo (ポリデモ): A pre-rendered cinematic sequence created using in-game polygons.","",""

When I think about how six years have already passed, while at the same time seeing the current state of Kobe, which hasn't fully recovered, it makes my heart ache. My son is now seven years old; back then, he wasn't even two. Time flies by too quickly. But the alleviation of people's suffering is far too slow. I finished reading ""A Catskill Eagle"" from the Spencer series. The irresponsibility of the plot really got to me. Since the end of last year, I've read six Parker novels in a row, but I'll take a break for now. I picked up Pollock's latest book, which I bought at the end of the year. I noticed several Spencer series books on Ueno's desk. It irritates me to think of someone else reading them before I do. It’s an odd feeling of jealousy. I borrowed the meeting room and holed up for the first time in a while. I have to finish the script revisions by tomorrow. Somehow, I end up tweaking the gameplay elements as well. The meeting room really helps me focus. I finally finished the revisions and put them into the database. I went for a swim at the club for the first time in about a month. I can't stop thinking about the underwater effects. Using a raster effect underwater is still strange. What actually appears to waver is the light beneath the surface. When the camera goes underwater, the light from above the surface is transmitted and refracts at the water's surface. We need to extract this wavering effect properly. The rain splash effect was something I thought of when Oshii showed me the digital remix of the ""Patlabor: The Movie"" for the DVD. My memory is a bit hazy, but I think it was in the scene at the port in the rain. Instead of drawing rain lines directly in cel animation, they skillfully used a special effects brush to only show the splashes bouncing off the characters' shoulders. I thought, ""Oh, you can express it this way too?"" It's a way to show things by not intentionally showing them. If it were Disney, they'd spend money and time drawing every single droplet running down the body. The underwater controls still need some work. Something is missing. I asked them to change the camera distance according to speed and the feature of moving by inertia. But what exactly is missing? I decided to name the inside of the Arsenal with terms like ""stomach"" and ""rectum."" The names of the ascending and transverse colons sound somewhat close to deck names. I considered using terms like ""womb"" and ""genitals,"" but ethical concerns would make it complicated. The more immature staff members also opposed it. So, I decided to drop it. It's like Pinocchio being swallowed by the whale. But in this case, Raiden is swallowed by a giant mass of information and exits not through the mouth but by being digested and expelled from the rear. Regarding Raiden's nude scene, I plan to give him a tattoo on his butt cheek.","01/1/17 (Wednesday) Six years have passed today since the Great Hanshin Earthquake. I couldn’t believe it had been six years already, but at the same time when I see news about the current situation in Kobe, which has not yet fully recovered, I feel pain in my chest. My son is 7 years old, but he was less than 2 years old at that time. Time flies by too quickly, yet human pain alleviates far too slowly. Finished reading A Catskill Eagle from the Spencer series. The plot is so irresponsible that I am indeed overwhelmed. I have been reading six of Parker's novels in a row since the end of the year, but I will stop for a while. Read Pollock's new book, which I had purchased at the end of the year. I found several books of the Spenser series at Ueno's seat. I was annoyed that he read them before me. I feel strangely jealous. I borrowed the reception room and stayed there for a while. I have to finish revising the scriptment by tomorrow. I keep messing with the game parts. But in the reception room, I can concentrate. I managed to finish the revisions and put them into the database. I went swimming at the club for the first time in almost a month. I'm worried about the effects in the underwater scenes. Raster looks strange underwater. It only appears to shake like that just under the water’s surface. When the camera is underwater, light penetrates from above the surface. That light is refracted on the surface of the water. This shimmering element must be sampled well. The idea for the rain droplets came to me by chance when Oshii showed me how they did the digital remixing for the DVD of Patlabor: The Movie. I am not sure if my memory is correct, but I think it was how it was expressed in the rain scene at the port. Instead of drawing the lines of the rain directly on the celluloid, he used a special effects brush to deform only the droplets that bounced off the character's shoulders. Who knew this kind of representation was even possible? I was impressed that there is a way to make something visible without showing it intentionally. If it were Disney, they would have spent a lot of time and money to draw every drop of water that trickled down the body. The feel of the underwater controls is just one more step from being ready. Something is missing. I would like to see a specification that allows the camera to move forward in a fun way and to change the distance of the camera depending on speed. But what is missing that would provide that? Will name the interior parts of the arsenal as stomach, rectum, etc. Use pronunciations somewhere close to deck names, such as ascending colon or transverse colon. I was going to use uterus or vagina, but ethics complicate things. I also met opposition from the childish staff. I decided against it. It is the same as Pinocchio who was swallowed by the whale. However, Raiden is swallowed by a giant mass of information and is digested from the rear, rather than from the mouth. Raiden will be entirely naked. Will put a tattoo on his butt.","","",""

It’s a newer type of automated commuter pass machine compared to last time. Now it’s possible to buy a new pass directly from the machine, whereas before, new passes had to be purchased at the counter. When I inserted the previous commuter pass, the new one instantly appeared in large letters on the monitor. The text is bigger, making it easier for people with poor eyesight or the elderly to read. It’s convenient. The node terminals need to adopt the same kind of consideration. The new pass is valid until April 18. Whenever I buy a new pass, I look at the ""date"" and think about where the development of MGS2 will be by the time it expires. By April, things should be progressing quite rapidly. The voice recording for the dramatic scenes should be finished. What about the boss enemies? The capture...? Every day, I board the train thinking about these things. And every day, this becomes a source of stress and pressure. I have a meeting with Asatsu and Konami JPN about the commercial. I ask Okamura to prepare materials for Z.O.E. In the Fortune battle, Raiden’s clothes are on fire. Seeing this gave me an idea. His long, proud hair also catches fire, and if left alone, his head will end up bald by this point. From then on, even in the poly demo, he would continue with a shaved head. However, we could include various ""wigs"" as items. Naturally, there would be one resembling Raiden’s usual hairstyle. There would also be a ""Baka Tonosama"" wig. Every time Raiden does actions like cartwheels or flips while wearing a wig, it would fall off. Once the wig falls to the floor, it would become an item box again. A cool protagonist would end up bald during the first boss fight. I find this extremely amusing. It could even be reflected in the poly demo. But the staff are against it. I wonder if it’ll be scrapped. There’s an interrogation room inside Arsenal. Just like in the previous game, we’ll place a cardboard box next to the naked Raiden. Returning players would think they could recover their equipment and pick up the box. Raiden changes clothes behind the cover of the interrogation room. But after he finishes changing and steps out, Raiden remains naked, with only the cardboard box covering his waist... It's a joke. I find this funny, but since it requires a lot of work, it’s on hold. We’re trying to place Ocelot in the third slant corridor, but we can’t find the right position. Since we can’t give him any movement, this remains an issue. We’ll try to find a position that works with the current motion. I don’t know how many people will figure out this specification on their own, but MGS2 is a game, after all. Raiden’s blood has been changed from white to red. I initially wanted to link this with Redwood from Policenauts, but I’ve abandoned the idea. Since the sprites are additive, the white blood would glow, especially underwater. Red blood is working well in the current setup, so I’m going with that. I’ve also removed the “milk blood” plot from the script. Instead, I’m toying with a new idea: Emma bleeds from her groin (underwater). Raiden, concerned, asks, “Emma, can you show me the blood?” She blushes and says, “I’m fine,” then inserts a tampon. As a bonus, when Raiden worries about how much she’s bleeding, Emma reassures him with “It’s okay, it’s just my period” before she quietly dies. When I shared this with the staff, it was met with almost universal disapproval.","01/1/18 (Thursday) Purchased a commuter pass in the morning. The automatic commuter pass machine was newer than last time. You can also buy new passes now. Previously, new customers had to go to the ticket counter. When I inserted my old commuter pass, the new commuter pass displayed in large size on the monitor. The large letters are designed so that even people with poor eyesight and the elderly can see the new pass. It has become very convenient. The node terminal should do the same. My new commuter pass is valid until April 18. Whenever I buy a pass, I look at the date and think about when it will expire and where the development of MGS2 will be at that time. By April, it should be moving along quite well, and at an accelerated pace. The recording and the drama parts will be done. What about the bosses? The motion capture will……. etc., etc. Every day, end up confirming those details as I ride the train. Every day, it adds to my stress and pressure. Had a meeting with Asatsu and Konami JPN. Asked Okamura for materials for Z.O.E. Raiden's clothes are on fire during the battle with Fortune. I came up with the idea of seeing that. Raiden's long hair, which he is proud of, is also on fire, and if he leaves it alone, his head becomes bald. After that, he proceeds completely bald, even in cutscenes. However, various ""wigs"" can be prepared with items. Naturally, there are some with Raiden's hair style. There is also the ""Bakatono"" wig. When wearing this wig, it will fall off whenever the player performs actions such as flips and somersaults. When the wig falls to the floor, it becomes an item box again on the spot. The good-looking protagonist ends up bald from the first boss battle. Incredibly funny. It can even translate into the poly cutscenes. However, it met with opposition from the staff. I guess it’s a no-go? The torture room in the Arsenal. Just like in the last game, will place a cardboard box next to a naked Raiden. Veteran players will think they can get their equipment back and retrieve the box. Raiden gets dressed in the shadows of the torture room. When he finishes changing and comes out, he is completely naked and has the cardboard box around his waist....as a joke. This is also funny, but it will take a lot of work, so I put it on hold. I had them place Ocelot in the third hold, but they couldn't find a good position for him. Since it is not possible to give him animations, we will need to consider it. We will try to find a position where that works using only current animations. I don't know how many people will be able to find this specification on their own. MGS2 is ultimately a game. Changed Raiden's blood from white to red. I was thinking of linking him to Redwood in Policenauts, but decided against it. The sprites are additive, so the white color would shine, especially underwater. Currently, red blood is displaying a lot better, so I'll go with red. Removed the milk blood plot from the story as well. Instead, I will come up with a way to make Emma bleed (underwater) from her crotch. Will add a sequence where Raiden, who can't stand to watch, asks, ""Emma, where are you hurt?”, and she blushes and says ""I'm fine"". Then there is the scene where Emma dies after being stabbed by Vamp. When Raiden is concerned about the amount of blood she is losing, she says, ""I'm fine, it’s just my period” and Emma quietly breathes her last. When I told the staff, I got nearly 100% disapproval.","Asatsu (アサツー): Refers to the Asatsu-DK advertising agency (now known as ADK), a major ad company in Japan.

The ""Cowboy Segment,"" which wasn’t very interesting even on set, will have to be scrapped—what a waste.

That director is quite talented. I'll have to thank them later. Creating something like that in such a short time isn't something just anyone can do. My only regret is that the ending didn't quite wrap things up. However, as always, there are the usual mistakes, like referring to ""Yoji Shinkawa"" or saying ""Okamura created Tokimeki,"" which is frustrating. At Johnny's station, the naked Raiden (temporary) model appeared. It's incredibly impactful. It’s just the model of the Skull Suit with a flesh-colored texture! This stirs up some fighting spirit. This idea is a go!! I checked RAY Hangar 1 at Yamashita-kun's station. Since the naked Raiden looks like it’ll work, we'll go with a forgiving design that allows players to progress on either the upper or lower path without raising the difficulty too much. I came up with the final design for the Tanker Chapter poster series. I discreetly handed it to Kanekichi so that no one else would find out. If this works, it will add even more elements to that 3D poster. The problem is who will play the male counterpart. If no one volunteers, I might have to be the model myself. After the Gurlukovich disguise event, players will still be able to change their clothes. Of course, it won't have the bonus of disguising them, but it will be fun visually. The in-game cinematics will also support this. Whether this is possible depends on memory constraints.","01/2/6 (Tuesday) Watched the tentative edits of the commercials. The “Cowboy” version, which was uninteresting even on site, is a waste of time, so we decided to drop it.

My regret is that the conclusion of the program was not quite coherent. Mistakes like spelling Yoji Shinkawa’s name wrong and saying that “Okamura made 'Tokimeki'"" put me at a loss.

Since the naked Raiden looks good, I'm going to design the upper and lower courses more leniently so you can proceed through either without raising the difficulty level too much. I came up with an idea for one last element for the Tanker poster series. I will give it to Kanekichi so that no one else will know. If this works, it will add another element to the 3-D poster. The question is who will play the other guy. If no one is willing to play the role, I will have to be the subject of the poster. Made it so you can change clothes even after the Gurlukovich disguise event. Of course, you won’t get the benefit of being in disguise, but just the change in appearance will be fun.

High-frequency microtremors are happening frequently. It was even reported on the morning news. Could there be a major eruption? In the morning, we had a meeting about the Harrier battle. The plan is to create the basic guidelines by the end of February and build from there. Here, the priority is on visuals over gameplay. The effects will be enhanced until around May. The gameplay difficulty won’t be too high. Since the effects are handled by a different team, managing the processing is the main concern. I looked at the sample screen for the sea roaches. It’s just a placement of 4,000 polygon models, but it’s more unsettling than I imagined. At this rate, it should match the concept. Now we'll make the sea roaches move to see how well we can capture the atmosphere. I’m looking forward to it. It seems we can't actually reach 4,000 in number. The original idea of ""covering the entire floor!"" is no longer possible. Our initial vision for the numbers has now faded away with this specification. A link to the Z.O.E BBS was posted on the Konami homepage's CS bulletin board. There were twice as many posts as usual, but it’s still not enough. We added a new feature for the naked Raiden. If you approach the torture device from behind again, you can raise both hands to pretend you’re being captured. At that moment, the part that shouldn't be seen in the groin area is cleverly concealed by an empty can on the window sash. Okajii's muddy stream looks great!

However, from a gameplay perspective, it’s similar to the rolling boulder in Crash. It's quite plain and lacks freshness. Since the setting was decided to be at sea, this was a gimmick I really wanted to do, so it’s hard to let go.

Lately, my health has been terrible. My stomach and intestines are in the worst condition. To top it off, I have a severe headache today. I bought a liquid version of Kakkontō at the pharmacy, but even after taking it, the pain won't go away. While checking the game, I’m thinking about the video structure for TGS. Maybe it’s best not to reveal Raiden after all. We’ve had people play the game for a few days now, and the surprise when it shifts from Snake to Raiden seems strong. It would probably be wise to use this as an explosive reveal. When it’s released in America, we’ll use CM and promotions to expose Raiden. Everyone will be shocked. This isn’t a TV series. Sequels need the kind of surprises that defy users' expectations. Kyle's opening was integrated into the game. Just in the nick of time. At night, an incident occurred. It took many lives and shattered our dreams.","01/9/11 (Tuesday) Two typhoons are approaching, and typhoon No. 15 is already close. But so far, the rain and wind have not been too bad. Trains are running normally. I have been working more than 20 hours a day, without a break. At this time of year, people are divided into two types. There are those who try to escape from the hardships of development. They suddenly say, ""I need to… , I want to go to….. "" or ""I've had enough of development, I want it to be over.” The other type is the people who only think about the project saying ""I don't have enough time, if only I had more time.” The former is not suited for creating things. My health has been terrible recently. My stomach and intestines are at their worst. And on top of all of that, I have a severe headache today. I bought a bottle of arrowroot solution at the pharmacy, but it didn't take away the pain. While checking the game, I thought about the composition of the TGS video. I think it would be better not to include Raiden. I've been having people play on the monitor for a few days, and the surprise around the switch from Snake to Raiden seems to be high. It would probably be wise to use this as a catalyst. Expose Raiden in commercials and promotions for an explosive American release. No doubt it will be a surprise to everyone. This isn’t a TV series, the sequel needs to surprise the audience. Integrated Kyle's OP into the game. It was just in time. At night, an incident happened. It took away many lives and our dreams.","Kakkontō (葛根湯): A traditional Chinese herbal medicine often used in Japan for colds and flu symptoms","",""

With the U.S. terrorist attacks and the anthrax incidents, it’s not a time for unrestrained celebration, but it is a milestone nonetheless. What will become of this world from now on? There’s still ongoing anxiety, but this state of constant busyness will finally come to an end after three years. I’d like to take it easy for a while. However, even though the master is finished, there are still press events, interviews, release preparations, and promotions to handle until December. I can’t let my guard down. This time, I am truly exhausted. I finished reading Umehara's Sci-Fi Moon. It’s interesting. It would be fascinating if someone like Carpenter adapted it into a movie. It might not be a hit, but I like this kind of world. It has an '80s sci-fi vibe, so it would probably only appeal to that generation (people in their 30s and older).","01/10/19 (Friday) The production is scheduled to finish today. I can't be happy about it because the situation is not normal with the terrorist attacks in the U.S. and anthrax, but at least it's a break. What will happen to the world in the future? I am still anxious, but for the first time in three years, my busyness in the midst of anxiety will be relieved. I want to relax for the first time in a while. However, once the master is finished, I will not be able to relax until December with all the presentations, interviews, preparation for the launch, and promotions. But this time, I am really tired. I'm exhausted. I finished reading Sci-Fi Moon by Umehara. It's interesting. It would be cool if Carventer made a movie out of it. It's not likely to be a hit, but I like this kind of world, but since it’s 80’s sci-fi, probably only people in their 30’s and up would enjoy it.","","",""
"scan/entry_174.png","01・11・27(火) 午後、先生に診断をしてもらう。仕方のないことだ が、これまでの経緯からすると、すでに僕は「オオカ ミ少年」のようで、あまり真剣には取り合ってくれな いようだ。前回のこともある。また本当にストレスだ けなのかもしれない。7月末の1日人間ドックの結果 を見ながらの問診、背中の痛い部分は膵臓が怪しい らしい。胃痛のほうはガスターとセルベックスを1週 間分もらう。 一応、血液を採取、検査にまわすらしい。検査結果 は月曜日に出るようだ。先生に「MGS2」 ソフトを渡 す。 背中の痛みが膵臓であれば、酒は飲めないとのこと。 膵臓と言われても、あまりなじみがない。どういう器 官なのかもあやふや。･･････臓がつくということは大切 な器官なのだろう。どっちにしろ、原因がわからなけ れば安心できない。 ただ、もらった薬を服用しても胃の痛みは治まらない。 胃の中が空になると痛み出すような気がする。そうな れば、この薬が胃酸を抑えて効くはずなのだが。 とにかく痛い。集中できない。 昼に真保裕一のエッセイ (インタビュー) 本を買う。 カーペンターやブライアン・シンガー、スティーブン・ ノリントンらに贈る、限定版に入れる挨拶状にサイン をする。なんとなく嬉しい。コメントを入れようとし たが、英文が怪しいのでやめる。","01•11•27 (Tuesday) In the afternoon, I had a consultation with the doctor. It can't be helped, but given the history so far, I already feel like ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf,"" so it seems they aren't taking me very seriously. There's also what happened last time. Maybe it really is just stress again. As we went over the results of my full-body checkup from the end of July, the doctor suggested that the painful area in my back might indicate an issue with the pancreas. For the stomach pain, I was given a week's supply of Gaster and Selbex. They took a blood sample to send for testing. The results should be ready by Monday. I gave the doctor a copy of the MGS2 software. If the back pain is due to the pancreas, I won't be able to drink alcohol. But the pancreas is not something I'm very familiar with. I'm vague about what kind of organ it is. Still, since it has ""organ"" in its name (臓), it must be important. In any case, I can’t feel at ease until we find out the cause. However, even after taking the prescribed medication, the stomach pain doesn't subside. It seems to start hurting when my stomach is empty. If that's the case, this medication should suppress stomach acid and be effective. But in any case, it hurts. I can't concentrate. I bought Yūichi Shinpo's essay (interview) book at noon. I signed greeting cards to be included in the limited edition copies sent to Carpenter, Bryan Singer, and Stephen Norrington. Somehow, this makes me happy. I thought about adding a comment, but I decided against it because my English is a bit shaky.","01/11/27 (Tuesday) In the afternoon, I went to the doctor for a diagnosis. Unfortunately, it seems that I'm already like “the boy who cried wolf”, and they don't take me seriously, given my history. It may really just be stress again. Looking at the results of a one-day physical checkup I had at the end of July, they said the painful part of my back might be a tumor. For the stomachache, they gave me a week's supply of Gastar and Selbex. They are going to take blood samples and run some tests just in case. The results are expected on Monday. I gave the doctor a copy of MGS2. He said that if the pain is in my pancreas, I can't drink alcohol. I am not familiar with the term pancreas. The name sounds like it is an important organ. Either way, I won't be relieved if I don't know the cause. However, the pain in my stomach does not go away even after taking the medicine I was given. It seems as if it starts to hurt whenever my stomach is empty. If that happens, this medicine should help by suppressing stomach acid. Anyway, it hurts. I can't concentrate. In the afternoon, I bought a book of essays (interviews) by Yuichi Shimpo. I signed the greeting cards for the limited editions of the game, which will be sent to Carpenter, Bryan Singer, Stephen Norrington, and others. I am somewhat happy.

I went through it all, cutting out personal names, store names, and sensitive parts. It’s now about half its original length, but as I read through it, even I find it interesting. Just a moment ago, a serviceman from the USS Kitty Hawk and a foreign news anchor (who speaks Japanese) came to the Konami Japan reception. They called yesterday. I signed their MGS2 copies, and in exchange, they gave me a USS Kitty Hawk cap. They had apparently been to Afghanistan until recently, and it seems they will set sail again after the New Year. They haven't played MGS yet. The Year of the Snake is almost over. Somehow, it doesn’t feel very satisfying.

We went through and checked it and cut out the names of individuals, stores, and other risky parts. I'm about halfway done, but it's interesting to read through. A few minutes ago, a soldier who was on the Kitty Hawk and a foreign newscaster (who speaks Japanese), came to the reception of Konami JPN. They were the ones who had called me yesterday.
